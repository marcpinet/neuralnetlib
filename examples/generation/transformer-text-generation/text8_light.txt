 anarchism originated as a term of abuse first used against early working class radicals including the diggers of the english revolution and the sans culottes of the french revolution whilst the term is still used in a pejorative way to describe any act that used violent means to destroy the organization of society it has also been taken up as a positive label by self defined anarchists the word anarchism is derived from the greek without archons ruler chief king anarchism as a political philosophy is the belief that rulers are unnecessary and should be abolished although there are differing interpretations of what this means anarchism also refers to related social movements that advocate the elimination of authoritarian institutions particularly the state the word anarchy as most anarchists use it does not imply chaos nihilism or anomie but rather a harmonious anti authoritarian society in place of what are regarded as authoritarian political structures and coercive economic institutions anarchists advocate social relations based upon voluntary association of autonomous individuals mutual aid and self governance while anarchism is most easily defined by what it is against anarchists also offer positive visions of what they believe to be a truly free society however ideas about how an anarchist society might work vary considerably especially with respect to economics there is also disagreement about how a free society might be brought about origins and predecessors kropotkin and others argue that before recorded history human society was organized on anarchist principles most anthropologists follow kropotkin and engels in believing that hunter gatherer bands were egalitarian and lacked division of labour accumulated wealth or decreed law and had equal access to resources william godwin anarchists including the the anarchy organisation and rothbard find anarchist attitudes in taoism from ancient china kropotkin found similar ideas in stoic zeno of citium according to kropotkin zeno repudiated the omnipotence of the state its intervention and regimentation and proclaimed the sovereignty of the moral law of the individual the anabaptists of one six th century europe are sometimes considered to be religious forerunners of modern anarchism bertrand russell in his history of western philosophy writes that the anabaptists repudiated all law since they held that the good man will be guided at every moment by the holy spirit from this premise they arrive at communism the diggers or true levellers were an early communistic movement during the time of the english civil war and are considered by some as forerunners of modern anarchism in the modern era the first to use the term to mean something other than chaos was louis armand baron de lahontan in his nouveaux voyages dans l am rique septentrionale one seven zero three where he described the indigenous american society which had no state laws prisons priests or private property as being in anarchy russell means a libertarian and leader in the american indian movement has repeatedly stated that he is an anarchist and so are all his ancestors in one seven nine three in the thick of the french revolution william godwin published an enquiry concerning political justice although godwin did not use the word anarchism many later anarchists have regarded this book as the first major anarchist text and godwin as the founder of philosophical anarchism but at this point no anarchist movement yet existed and the term anarchiste was known mainly as an insult hurled by the bourgeois girondins at more radical elements in the french revolution the first self labelled anarchist pierre joseph proudhon it is commonly held that it wasn t until pierre joseph proudhon published what is property in one eight four zero that the term anarchist was adopted as a self description it is for this reason that some claim proudhon as the founder of modern anarchist theory in what is property proudhon answers with the famous accusation property is theft in this work he opposed the institution of decreed property propri t where owners have complete rights to use and abuse their property as they wish such as exploiting workers for profit in its place proudhon supported what he called possession individuals can have limited rights to use resources capital and goods in accordance with principles of equality and justice proudhon s vision of anarchy which he called mutualism mutuellisme involved an exchange economy where individuals and groups could trade the products of their labor using labor notes which represented the amount of working time involved in production this would ensure that no one would profit from the labor of others workers could freely join together in co operative workshops an interest free bank would be set up to provide everyone with access to the means of production proudhon s ideas were influential within french working class movements and his followers were active in the revolution of one eight four eight in france proudhon s philosophy of property is complex it was developed in a number of works over his lifetime and there are differing interpretations of some of his ideas for more detailed discussion see here max stirner s egoism in his the ego and its own stirner argued that most commonly accepted social institutions including the notion of state property as a right natural rights in general and the very notion of society were mere illusions or ghosts in the mind saying of society that the individuals are its reality he advocated egoism and a form of amoralism in which individuals would unite in associations of egoists only when it was in their self interest to do so for him property simply comes about through might whoever knows how to take to defend the thing to him belongs property and what i have in my power that is my own so long as i assert myself as holder i am the proprietor of the thing stirner never called himself an anarchist he accepted only the label egoist nevertheless his ideas were influential on many individualistically inclined anarchists although interpretations of his thought are diverse american individualist anarchism benjamin tucker in one eight two five josiah warren had participated in a communitarian experiment headed by robert owen called new harmony which failed in a few years amidst much internal conflict warren blamed the community s failure on a lack of individual sovereignty and a lack of private property warren proceeded to organise experimenal anarchist communities which respected what he called the sovereignty of the individual at utopia and modern times in one eight three three warren wrote and published the peaceful revolutionist which some have noted to be the first anarchist periodical ever published benjamin tucker says that warren was the first man to expound and formulate the doctrine now known as anarchism liberty xiv december one nine zero zero one benjamin tucker became interested in anarchism through meeting josiah warren and william b greene he edited and published liberty from august one eight eight one to april one nine zero eight it is widely considered to be the finest individualist anarchist periodical ever issued in the english language tucker s conception of individualist anarchism incorporated the ideas of a variety of theorists greene s ideas on mutual banking warren s ideas on cost as the limit of price a heterodox variety of labour theory of value proudhon s market anarchism max stirner s egoism and herbert spencer s law of equal freedom tucker strongly supported the individual s right to own the product of his or her labour as private property and believed in a market economy for trading this property he argued that in a truly free market system without the state the abundance of competition would eliminate profits and ensure that all workers received the full value of their labor other one nine th century individualists included lysander spooner stephen pearl andrews and victor yarros the first international mikhail bakunin one eight one four one eight seven six in europe harsh reaction followed the revolutions of one eight four eight twenty years later in one eight six four the international workingmen s association sometimes called the first international united some diverse european revolutionary currents including anarchism due to its genuine links to active workers movements the international became signficiant from the start karl marx was a leading figure in the international he was elected to every succeeding general council of the association the first objections to marx came from the mutualists who opposed communism and statism shortly after mikhail bakunin and his followers joined in one eight six eight the first international became polarised into two camps with marx and bakunin as their respective figureheads the clearest difference between the camps was over strategy the anarchists around bakunin favoured in kropotkin s words direct economical struggle against capitalism without interfering in the political parliamentary agitation at that time marx and his followers focused on parliamentary activity bakunin characterised marx s ideas as authoritarian and predicted that if a marxist party gained to power its leaders would end up as bad as the ruling class they had fought against in one eight seven two the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the hague congress this is often cited as the origin of the conflict between anarchists and marxists from this moment the social democratic and libertarian currents of socialism had distinct organisations including rival internationals anarchist communism peter kropotkin proudhon and bakunin both opposed communism associating it with statism however in the one eight seven zero s many anarchists moved away from bakunin s economic thinking called collectivism and embraced communist concepts communists believed the means of production should be owned collectively and that goods be distributed by need not labor an early anarchist communist was joseph d jacque the first person to describe himself as libertarian unlike proudhon he argued that it is not the product of his or her labor that the worker has a right to but to the satisfaction of his or her needs whatever may be their nature he announced his ideas in his us published journal le libertaire one eight five eight one eight six one peter kropotkin often seen as the most important theorist outlined his economic ideas in the conquest of bread and fields factories and workshops he felt co operation is more beneficial than competition illustrated in nature in mutual aid a factor of evolution one eight nine seven subsequent anarchist communists include emma goldman and alexander berkman many in the anarcho syndicalist movements see below saw anarchist communism as their objective isaac puente s one nine three two comunismo libertario was adopted by the spanish cnt as its manifesto for a post revolutionary society some anarchists disliked merging communism with anarchism several individualist anarchists maintained that abolition of private property was not consistent with liberty for example benjamin tucker whilst professing respect for kropotkin and publishing his work described communist anarchism as pseudo anarchism propaganda of the deed johann most was an outspoken advocate of violence anarchists have often been portrayed as dangerous and violent due mainly to a number of high profile violent acts including riots assassinations insurrections and terrorism by some anarchists some revolutionaries of the late one nine th century encouraged acts of political violence such as bombings and the assassinations of heads of state to further anarchism such actions have sometimes been called propaganda by the deed one of the more outspoken advocates of this strategy was johann most who said the existing system will be quickest and most radically overthrown by the annihilation of its exponents therefore massacres of the enemies of the people must be set in motion most s preferred method of terrorism dynamite earned him the moniker dynamost however there is no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence in general mikhail bakunin and errico malatesta for example wrote of violence as a necessary and sometimes desirable force in revolutionary settings but at the same time they denounced acts of individual terrorism malatesta in on violence and bakunin when he refuted nechaev other anarchists sometimes identified as pacifist anarchists advocated complete nonviolence leo tolstoy whose philosophy is often viewed as a form of christian anarchism see below was a notable exponent of nonviolent resistance anarchism in the labour movement the red and black flag coming from the experience of anarchists in the labour movement is particularly associated with anarcho syndicalism anarcho syndicalism was an early two zero th century working class movement seeking to overthrow capitalism and the state to institute a worker controlled society the movement pursued industrial actions such as general strike as a primary strategy many anarcho syndicalists believed in anarchist communism though not all communists believed in syndicalism after the one eight seven one repression french anarchism reemerged influencing the bourses de travails of autonomous workers groups and trade unions from this movement the conf d ration g n rale du travail general confederation of work cgt was formed in one eight nine five as the first major anarcho syndicalist movement emile pataud and emile pouget s writing for the cgt saw libertarian communism developing from a general strike after one nine one four the cgt moved away from anarcho syndicalism due to the appeal of bolshevism french style syndicalism was a significant movement in europe prior to one nine two one and remained a significant movement in spain until the mid one nine four zero s the industrial workers of the world iww founded in one nine zero five in the us espoused unionism and sought a general strike to usher in a stateless society in one nine two three one zero zero zero zero zero members existed with the support of up to three zero zero zero zero zero though not explicitly anarchist they organized by rank and file democracy embodying a spirit of resistance that has inspired many anglophone syndicalists cnt propaganda from april two zero zero four reads don t let the politicians rule our lives you vote and they decide don t allow it unity action self management spanish anarchist trade union federations were formed in the one eight seven zero s one nine zero zero and one nine one zero the most successful was the confederaci n nacional del trabajo national confederation of labour cnt founded in one nine one zero prior to the one nine four zero s the cnt was the major force in spanish working class politics with a membership of one five eight million in one nine three four the cnt played a major role in the spanish civil war see also anarchism in spain syndicalists like ricardo flores mag n were key figures in the mexican revolution latin american anarchism was strongly influenced extending to the zapatista rebellion and the factory occupation movements in argentina in berlin in one nine two two the cnt was joined with the international workers association an anarcho syndicalist successor to the first international contemporary anarcho syndicalism continues as a minor force in many socities much smaller than in the one nine one zero s two zero s and three zero s the largest organised anarchist movement today is in spain in the form of the confederaci n general del trabajo and the cnt the cgt claims a paid up membership of six zero zero zero zero and received over a million votes in spanish syndical elections other active syndicalist movements include the us workers solidarity alliance and the uk solidarity federation the revolutionary industrial unionist industrial workers of the world also exists claiming two zero zero zero paid members contemporary critics of anarcho syndicalism and revolutionary industrial unionism claim that they are workerist and fail to deal with economic life outside work post leftist critics such as bob black claim anarcho syndicalism advocates oppressive social structures such as work and the workplace anarcho syndicalists in general uphold principles of workers solidarity direct action and self management the russian revolution the russian revolution of one nine one seven was a seismic event in the development of anarchism as a movement and as a philosophy anarchists participated alongside the bolsheviks in both february and october revolutions many anarchists initially supporting the bolshevik coup however the bolsheviks soon turned against the anarchists and other left wing opposition a conflict which culminated in the one nine one eight kronstadt rebellion anarchists in central russia were imprisoned or driven underground or joined the victorious bolsheviks in ukraine anarchists fought in the civil war against both whites and bolsheviks within the makhnovshchina peasant army led by nestor makhno expelled american anarchists emma goldman and alexander berkman before leaving russia were amongst those agitating in response to bolshevik policy and the suppression of the kronstadt uprising both wrote classic accounts of their experiences in russia aiming to expose the reality of bolshevik control for them bakunin s predictions about the consequences of marxist rule had proved all too true the victory of the bolsheviks in the october revolution and the resulting russian civil war did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally many workers and activists saw bolshevik success as setting an example communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements in france and the us for example the major syndicalist movements of the cgt and iww began to realign themselves away from anarchism and towards the communist international in paris the dielo truda group of russian anarchist exiles which included nestor makhno concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of bolshevism their one nine two six manifesto known as the organisational platform of the libertarian communists was supported by some communist anarchists though opposed by many others the platform continues to inspire some contemporary anarchist groups who believe in an anarchist movement organised around its principles of theoretical unity tactical unity collective responsibility and federalism platformist groups today include the workers solidarity movement in ireland the uk s anarchist federation and the late north eastern federation of anarchist communists in the northeastern united states and bordering canada the fight against fascism spain one nine three six members of the cnt construct armoured cars to fight against the fascists in one of the collectivised factories in the one nine two zero s and one nine three zero s the familiar dynamics of anarchism s conflict with the state were transformed by the rise of fascism in europe in many cases european anarchists faced difficult choices should they join in popular fronts with reformist democrats and soviet led communists against a common fascist enemy luigi fabbri an exile from italian fascism was amongst those arguing that fascism was something different fascism is not just another form of government which like all others uses violence it is the most authoritarian and the most violent form of government imaginable it represents the utmost glorification of the theory and practice of the principle of authority in france where the fascists came close to insurrection in the february one nine three four riots anarchists divided over a united front policy in spain the cnt initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance and abstention by cnt supporters led to a right wing election victory but in one nine three six the cnt changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power months later the ruling class responded with an attempted coup and the spanish civil war one nine three six three nine was underway in reponse to the army rebellion an anarchist inspired movement of peasants and workers supported by armed militias took control of the major city of barcelona and of large areas of rural spain where they collectivized the land but even before the eventual fascist victory in one nine three nine the anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the stalinists the cnt leadership often appeared confused and divided with some members controversially entering the government stalinist led troops suppressed the collectives and persecuted both dissident marxists and anarchists since the late one nine seven zero s anarchists have been involved in fighting the rise of neo fascist groups in germany and the united kingdom some anarchists worked within militant anti fascist groups alongside members of the marxist left they advocated directly combating fascists with physical force rather than relying on the state since the late one nine nine zero s a similar tendency has developed within us anarchism see also anti racist action us anti fascist action uk antifa religious anarchism leo tolstoy one eight two eight one nine one zero most anarchist culture tends to be secular if not outright anti religious however the combination of religious social conscience historical religiousity amongst oppressed social classes and the compatibility of some interpretations of religious traditions with anarchism has resulted in religious anarchism christian anarchists believe that there is no higher authority than god and oppose earthly authority such as government and established churches they believe that jesus teachings were clearly anarchistic but were corrupted when christianity was declared the official religion of rome christian anarchists who follow jesus directive to turn the other cheek are strict pacifists the most famous advocate of christian anarchism was leo tolstoy author of the kingdom of god is within you who called for a society based on compassion nonviolent principles and freedom christian anarchists tend to form experimental communities they also occasionally resist taxation many christian anarchists are vegetarian or vegan christian anarchy can be said to have roots as old as the religion s birth as the early church exhibits many anarchistic tendencies such as communal goods and wealth by aiming to obey utterly certain of the bible s teachings certain anabaptist groups of sixteenth century europe attempted to emulate the early church s social economic organisation and philosophy by regarding it as the only social structure capable of true obediance to jesus teachings and utterly rejected in theory all earthly hierarchies and authority and indeed non anabaptists in general and violence as ungodly such groups for example the hutterites typically went from initially anarchistic beginnings to as their movements stabalised more authoritarian social models chinese anarchism was most influential in the one nine two zero s strands of chinese anarchism included tai xu s buddhist anarchism which was influenced by tolstoy and the well field system neopaganism with its focus on the environment and equality along with its often decentralized nature has lead to a number of neopagan anarchists one of the most prominent is starhawk who writes extensively about both spirituality and activism anarchism and feminism emma goldman early french feminists such as jenny d h ricourt and juliette adam criticised the mysogyny in the anarchism of proudhon during the one eight five zero s anarcha feminism is a kind of radical feminism that espouses the belief that patriarchy is a fundamental problem in society while anarchist feminism has existed for more than a hundred years its explicit formulation as anarcha feminism dates back to the early seven zero s during the second wave feminist movement anarcha feminism views patriarchy as the first manifestation of hierarchy in human history thus the first form of oppression occurred in the dominance of male over female anarcha feminists then conclude that if feminists are against patriarchy they must also be against all forms of hierarchy and therefore must reject the authoritarian nature of the state and capitalism anarcho primitivists see the creation of gender roles and patriarchy a creation of the start of civilization and therefore consider primitivism to also be an anarchist school of thought that addresses feminist concerns eco feminism is often considered a feminist variant of green anarchist feminist thought anarcha feminism is most often associated with early two zero th century authors and theorists such as emma goldman and voltairine de cleyre although even early first wave feminist mary wollstonecraft held proto anarchist views and william godwin is often considered a feminist anarchist precursor it should be noted that goldman and de cleyre though they both opposed the state had opposing philosophies as de cleyre explains miss goldman is a communist i am an individualist she wishes to destroy the right of property i wish to assert it i make my war upon privilege and authority whereby the right of property the true right in that which is proper to the individual is annihilated she believes that co operation would entirely supplant competition i hold that competition in one form or another will always exist and that it is highly desirable it should in the spanish civil war an anarcha feminist group free women organized to defend both anarchist and feminist ideas in the modern day anarchist movement many anarchists male or female consider themselves feminists and anarcha feminist ideas are growing the publishing of quiet rumors an anarcha feminist reader has helped to spread various kinds of anti authoritarian and anarchist feminist ideas to the broader movement wendy mcelroy has popularized an individualist anarchism take on feminism in her books articles and individualist feminist website anarcho capitalism murray rothbard one nine two six one nine nine five anarcho capitalism is a predominantly united states based theoretical tradition that desires a stateless society with the economic system of free market capitalism unlike other branches of anarchism it does not oppose profit or capitalism consequently most anarchists do not recognise anarcho capitalism as a form of anarchism murray rothbard s synthesis of classical liberalism and austrian economics was germinal for the development of contemporary anarcho capitalist theory he defines anarcho capitalism in terms of the non aggression principle based on the concept of natural law competiting theorists use egoism utilitarianism used by david friedman or contractarianism used by jan narveson some minarchists such as ayn rand robert nozick and robert a heinlein have influenced anarcho capitalism some anarcho capitalists along with some right wing libertarian historians such as david hart and ralph raico considered similar philosophies existing prior to rothbard to be anarcho capitalist such as those of gustave de molinari and auberon herbert opponents of anarcho capitalists dispute these claims the place of anarcho capitalism within anarchism and indeed whether it is a form of anarchism at all is highly controversial for more on this debate see anarchism and anarcho capitalism anarchism and the environment since the late one nine seven zero s anarchists in anglophone and european countries have been taking action for the natural environment eco anarchists or green anarchists believe in deep ecology this is a worldview that embraces biodiversity and sustainability eco anarchists often use direct action against what they see as earth destroying institutions of particular importance is the earth first movement that takes action such as tree sitting another important component is ecofeminism which sees the domination of nature as a metaphor for the domination of women green anarchism also involves a critique of industrial capitalism and for some green anarchists civilization itself primitivism is a predominantly western philosophy that advocates a return to a pre industrial and usually pre agricultural society it develops a critique of industrial civilization in this critique technology and development have alienated people from the natural world this philosophy develops themes present in the political action of the luddites and the writings of jean jacques rousseau primitivism developed in the context of the reclaim the streets earth first and the earth liberation front movements john zerzan wrote that civilization not just the state would need to fall for anarchy to be achieved anarcho primitivists point to the anti authoritarian nature of many primitive or hunter gatherer societies throughout the world s history as examples of anarchist societies other branches and offshoots anarchism generates many eclectic and syncretic philosophies and movements since the western social formet in the one nine six zero s and one nine seven zero s a number new of movements and schools have appeared most of these stances are limited to even smaller numbers than the schools and movements listed above hakim bey post left anarchy post left anarchy also called egoist anarchism seeks to distance itself from the traditional left communists liberals social democrats etc and to escape the confines of ideology in general post leftists argue that anarchism has been weakened by its long attachment to contrary leftist movements and single issue causes anti war anti nuclear etc it calls for a synthesis of anarchist thought and a specifically anti authoritarian revolutionary movement outside of the leftist milieu it often focuses on the individual rather than speaking in terms of class or other broad generalizations and shuns organizational tendencies in favor of the complete absence of explicit hierarchy important groups and individuals associated with post left anarchy include crimethinc the magazine anarchy a journal of desire armed and its editor jason mcquinn bob black hakim bey and others for more information see infoshop org s anarchy after leftism section and the post left section on anarchism ws see also post left anarchy post structuralism the term postanarchism was originated by saul newman first receiving popular attention in his book from bakunin to lacan to refer to a theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and poststructuralist thought subsequent to newman s use of the term however it has taken on a life of its own and a wide range of ideas including autonomism post left anarchy situationism post colonialism and zapatismo by its very nature post anarchism rejects the idea that it should be a coherent set of doctrines and beliefs as such it is difficult if not impossible to state with any degree of certainty who should or shouldn t be grouped under the rubric nonetheless key thinkers associated with post anarchism include saul newman todd may gilles deleuze and f lix guattari external reference postanarchism clearinghouse see also post anarchism insurrectionary anarchism insurrectionary anarchism is a form of revolutionary anarchism critical of formal anarchist labor unions and federations insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organization including small affinity groups carrying out acts of resistance in various struggles and mass organizations called base structures which can include exploited individuals who are not anarchists proponents include wolfi landstreicher and alfredo m bonanno author of works including armed joy and the anarchist tension this tendency is represented in the us in magazines such as willful disobedience and killing king abacus see also insurrectionary anarchism small a anarchism small a anarchism is a term used in two different but not unconnected contexts dave neal posited the term in opposition to big a anarchism in the article anarchism ideology or methodology while big a anarchism referred to ideological anarchists small a anarchism was applied to their methodological counterparts those who viewed anarchism as a way of acting or a historical tendency against illegitimate authority as an anti ideological position small a anarchism shares some similarities with post left anarchy david graeber and andrej grubacic offer an alternative use of the term applying it to groups and movements organising according to or acting in a manner consistent with anarchist principles of decentralisation voluntary association mutual aid the network model and crucially the rejection of any idea that the end justifies the means let alone that the business of a revolutionary is to seize state power and then begin imposing one s vision at the point of a gun other issues conceptions of an anarchist society many political philosophers justify support of the state as a means of regulating violence so that the destruction caused by human conflict is minimized and fair relationships are established anarchists argue that pursuit of these ends does not justify the establishment of a state many argue that the state is incompatible with those goals and the cause of chaos violence and war anarchists argue that the state helps to create a monopoly on violence and uses violence to advance elite interests much effort has been dedicated to explaining how anarchist societies would handle criminality see also anarchism and society civil rights and cultural sovereignty black anarchism opposes the existence of a state capitalism and subjugation and domination of people of color and favors a non hierarchical organization of society theorists include ashanti alston lorenzo komboa ervin and sam mbah anarchist people of color was created as a forum for non caucasian anarchists to express their thoughts about racial issues within the anarchist movement particularly within the united states national anarchism is a political view which seeks to unite cultural or ethnic preservation with anarchist views its adherents propose that those preventing ethnic groups or races from living in separate autonomous groupings should be resisted anti racist action is not an anarchist group but many anarchists are involved it focuses on publicly confronting racist agitators the zapatista movement of chiapas mexico is a cultural sovereignty group with some anarchist proclivities neocolonialism and globalization nearly all anarchists oppose neocolonialism as an attempt to use economic coercion on a global scale carried out through state institutions such as the world bank world trade organization group of eight and the world economic forum globalization is an ambiguous term that has different meanings to different anarchist factions most anarchists use the term to mean neocolonialism and or cultural imperialism which they may see as related many are active in the anti globalization movement others particularly anarcho capitalists use globalization to mean the worldwide expansion of the division of labor and trade which they see as beneficial so long as governments do not intervene parallel structures many anarchists try to set up alternatives to state supported institutions and outposts such as food not bombs infoshops educational systems such as home schooling neighborhood mediation arbitration groups and so on the idea is to create the structures for a new anti authoritarian society in the shell of the old authoritarian one technology recent technological developments have made the anarchist cause both easier to advance and more conceivable to people many people use the internet to form on line communities intellectual property is undermined and a gift culture supported by sharing music files open source programming and the free software movement these cyber communities include the gnu linux indymedia and wiki some anarchists see information technology as the best weapon to defeat authoritarianism some even think the information age makes eventual anarchy inevitable see also crypto anarchism and cypherpunk pacifism some anarchists consider pacifism opposition to war to be inherent in their philosophy anarcho pacifists take it further and follow leo tolstoy s belief in non violence anarchists see war as an activity in which the state seeks to gain and consolidate power both domestically and in foreign lands and subscribe to randolph bourne s view that war is the health of the state a lot of anarchist activity has been anti war based parliamentarianism in general terms the anarchist ethos opposes voting in elections because voting amounts to condoning the state voluntaryism is an anarchist school of thought which emphasizes tending your own garden and neither ballots nor bullets the anarchist case against voting is explained in the ethics of voting by george h smith also see voting anarchists an oxymoron or what by joe peacott and writings by fred woodworth sectarianism most anarchist schools of thought are to some degree sectarian there is often a difference of opinion within each school about how to react to or interact with other schools some such as panarchists believe that it is possible for a variety of modes of social life to coexist and compete some anarchists view opposing schools as a social impossibility and resist interaction others see opportunities for coalition building or at least temporary alliances for specific purposes see anarchism without adjectives criticisms of anarchism main article criticisms of anarchism violence since anarchism has often been associated with violence and destruction some people have seen it as being too violent on the other hand hand frederick engels criticsed anarchists for not being violent enough a revolution is certainly the most authoritarian thing there is it is the act whereby one part of the population imposes its will upon the other part by means of rifles bayonets and cannon authoritarian means if such there be at all and if the victorious party does not want to have fought in vain it must maintain this rule by means of the terror which its arms inspire in the reactionists would the paris commune have lasted a single day if it had not made use of this authority of the armed people against the bourgeois utopianism anarchism is often criticised as unfeasible or plain utopian even by many who agree that it s a nice idea in principle for example carl landauer in his book european socialism criticizes anarchism as being unrealistically utopian and holds that government is a lesser evil than a society without repressive force he holds that the belief that ill intentions will cease if repressive force disappears is an absurdity however it must be noted that not all anarchists have such a utopian view of anarchism for example some such as benjamin tucker advocate privately funded institutions that defend individual liberty and property however other anarchists such as sir herbert read proudly accept the characterization utopian class character marxists have characterised anarchism as an expression of the class interests of the petite bourgeoisie or perhaps the lumpenproletariat see e g plekhanov for a marxist critique of one eight nine five anarchists have also been characterised as spoilt middle class dilettantes most recently in relation to anti capitalist protesters tacit authoritarianism in recent decades anarchism has been criticised by situationists post anarchists and others of preserving tacitly statist authoritarian or bureaucratic tendencies behind a dogmatic facade hypocrisy some critics point to the sexist and racist views of some prominent anarchists notably proudhon and bakunin as examples of hypocrisy inherent within anarchism while many anarchists however dismiss that the personal prejudices of one nine th century theorists influence the beliefs of present day anarchists others criticise modern anarchism for continuing to be eurocentric and reference the impact of anarchist thinkers like proudhon on fascism through groups like cercle proudhon anarcho capitalist bryan caplan argues that the treatment of fascists and suspected fascist sympathizers by spanish anarchists in the spanish civil war was a form of illegitimate coercion making the proffessed anarchists ultimately just a third faction of totalitarians alongside the communists and fascists he also criticizes the willingness of the cnt to join the statist republican government during the civil war and references stanley g payne s book on the franco regime which claims that the cnt entered negotiations with the fascist government six years after the war cultural phenomena noam chomsky one nine two eight the kind of anarchism that is most easily encountered in popular culture is represented by celebrities who publicly identify themselves as anarchists although some anarchists reject any focus on such famous living individuals as inherently litist the following figures are examples of prominent publicly self avowed anarchists the mit professor of linguistics noam chomsky the science fiction author ursula k le guin the social historian howard zinn entertainer and author hans alfredsson the avant garde artist nicol s rossell in denmark the freetown christiania was created in downtown copenhagen the housing and employment crisis in most of western europe led to the formation of communes and squatter movements like the one still thriving in barcelona in catalonia militant resistance to neo nazi groups in places like germany and the uprisings of autonomous marxism situationist and autonomist groups in france and italy also helped to give popularity to anti authoritarian non capitalist ideas in various musical styles anarchism rose in popularity most famous for the linking of anarchist ideas and music has been punk rock although in the modern age hip hop and folk music are also becoming important mediums for the spreading of the anarchist message in the uk this was associated with the punk rock movement the band crass is celebrated for its anarchist and pacifist ideas the dutch punk band the ex

social philosophy autism is classified as a neurodevelopmental disorder that manifests itself in markedly abnormal social interaction communication ability patterns of interests and patterns of behavior although the specific etiology of autism is unknown many researchers suspect that autism results from genetically mediated vulnerabilities to environmental triggers and while there is disagreement about the magnitude nature and mechanisms for such environmental factors researchers have found at least seven major genes prevalent among individuals diagnosed as autistic some estimate that autism occurs in as many as one united states child in one six six however the national institute of mental health gives a more conservative estimate of one in one zero zero zero for families that already have one autistic child the odds of a second autistic child may be as high as one in twenty diagnosis is based on a list of psychiatric criteria and a series of standardized clinical tests may also be used autism may not be physiologically obvious a complete physical and neurological evaluation will typically be part of diagnosing autism some now speculate that autism is not a single condition but a group of several distinct conditions that manifest in similar ways by definition autism must manifest delays in social interaction language as used in social communication or symbolic or imaginative play with onset prior to age three years according to the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders the icd one zero also says that symptoms must manifest before the age of three years there have been large increases in the reported incidence of autism for reasons that are heavily debated by researchers in psychology and related fields within the scientific community some children with autism have improved their social and other skills to the point where they can fully participate in mainstream education and social events but there are lingering concerns that an absolute cure from autism is impossible with current technology however many autistic children and adults who are able to communicate at least in writing are opposed to attempts to cure their conditions and see such conditions as part of who they are history dr hans asperger described a form of autism in the one nine four zero s that later became known as asperger s syndrome the word autism was first used in the english language by swiss psychiatrist eugene bleuler in a one nine one two number of the american journal of insanity it comes from the greek word for self however the classification of autism did not occur until the middle of the twentieth century when in one nine four three psychiatrist dr leo kanner of the johns hopkins hospital in baltimore reported on one one child patients with striking behavioral similarities and introduced the label early infantile autism he suggested autism from the greek autos meaning self to describe the fact that the children seemed to lack interest in other people although kanner s first paper on the subject was published in a now defunct journal the nervous child almost every characteristic he originally described is still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders at the same time an austrian scientist dr hans asperger described a different form of autism that became known as asperger s syndrome but the widespread recognition of asperger s work was delayed by world war ii in germany and by the fact that his seminal paper wasn t translated into english for almost five zero years the majority of his work wasn t widely read until one nine nine seven thus these two conditions were described and are today listed in the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm iv tr fourth edition text revision one as two of the five pervasive developmental disorders pdd more often referred to today as autism spectrum disorders asd all of these conditions are characterized by varying degrees of difference in communication skills social interactions and restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior few clinicians today solely use the dsm iv criteria for determining a diagnosis of autism which are based on the absence or delay of certain developmental milestones many clinicians instead use an alternate means or a combination thereof to more accurately determine a diagnosis terminology when referring to someone diagnosed with autism the term autistic is often used however the term person with autism can be used instead this is referred to as person first terminology the autistic community generally prefers the term autistic for reasons that are fairly controversial this article uses the term autistic see talk page characteristics dr leo kanner introduced the label early infantile autism in one nine four three there is a great diversity in the skills and behaviors of individuals diagnosed as autistic and physicians will often arrive at different conclusions about the appropriate diagnosis much of this is due to the sensory system of an autistic which is quite different from the sensory system of other people since certain stimulations can affect an autistic differently than a non autistic and the degree to which the sensory system is affected varies wildly from one autistic person to another nevertheless professionals within pediatric care and development often look for early indicators of autism in order to initiate treatment as early as possible however some people do not believe in treatment for autism either because they do not believe autism is a disorder or because they believe treatment can do more harm than good social development typically developing infants are social beings early in life they do such things as gaze at people turn toward voices grasp a finger and even smile in contrast most autistic children prefer objects to faces and seem to have tremendous difficulty learning to engage in the give and take of everyday human interaction even in the first few months of life many seem indifferent to other people because they avoid eye contact and do not interact with them as often as non autistic children children with autism often appear to prefer being alone to the company of others and may passively accept such things as hugs and cuddling without reciprocating or resist attention altogether later they seldom seek comfort from others or respond to parents displays of anger or affection in a typical way research has suggested that although autistic children are attached to their parents their expression of this attachment is unusual and difficult to interpret parents who looked forward to the joys of cuddling teaching and playing with their child may feel crushed by this lack of expected attachment behavior children with autism appear to lack theory of mind the ability to see things from another person s perspective a behavior cited as exclusive to human beings above the age of five and possibly other higher primates such as adult gorillas chimpanzees and bonobos typical five year olds can develop insights into other people s different knowledge feelings and intentions interpretations based upon social cues e g gestures facial expressions an individual with autism seems to lack these interpretation skills an inability that leaves them unable to predict or understand other people s actions the social alienation of autistic and asperger s people is so intense from childhood that many of them have imaginary friends as companionship however having an imaginary friend is not necessarily a sign of autism and also occurs in non autistic children although not universal it is common for autistic people to not regulate their behavior this can take the form of crying or verbal outbursts that may seem out of proportion to the situation individuals with autism generally prefer consistent routines and environments they may react negatively to changes in them it is not uncommon for these individuals to exhibit aggression increased levels of self stimulatory behavior self injury or extensive withdrawal in overwhelming situations sensory system a key indicator to clinicians making a proper assessment for autism would include looking for symptoms much like those found in sensory integration dysfunction children will exhibit problems coping with the normal sensory input indicators of this disorder include oversensitivity or underreactivity to touch movement sights or sounds physical clumsiness or carelessness poor body awareness a tendency to be easily distracted impulsive physical or verbal behavior an activity level that is unusually high or low not unwinding or calming oneself difficulty learning new movements difficulty in making transitions from one situation to another social and or emotional problems delays in speech language or motor skills specific learning difficulties delays in academic achievement one common example is an individual with autism hearing a person with autism may have trouble hearing certain people while other people are louder than usual or the person with autism may be unable to filter out sounds in certain situations such as in a large crowd of people see cocktail party effect however this is perhaps the part of the autism that tends to vary the most from person to person so these examples may not apply to every autistic it should be noted that sensory difficulties although reportedly common in autistics are not part of the dsm iv diagnostic criteria for autistic disorder communication difficulties by age three typical children have passed predictable language learning milestones one of the earliest is babbling by the first birthday a typical toddler says words turns when he or she hears his or her name points when he or she wants a toy and when offered something distasteful makes it clear that the answer is no speech development in people with autism takes different paths some remain mute throughout their lives while being fully literate and able to communicate in other ways images sign language and typing are far more natural to them some infants who later show signs of autism coo and babble during the first few months of life but stop soon afterwards others may be delayed developing language as late as the teenage years still inability to speak does not mean that people with autism are unintelligent or unaware once given appropriate accommodations many will happily converse for hours and can often be found in online chat rooms discussion boards or websites and even using communication devices at autism community social events such as autreat those who do speak often use language in unusual ways retaining features of earlier stages of language development for long periods or throughout their lives some speak only single words while others repeat the same phrase over and over some repeat what they hear a condition called echolalia sing song repetitions in particular are a calming joyous activity that many autistic adults engage in many people with autism have a strong tonal sense and can often understand spoken language some children may exhibit only slight delays in language or even seem to have precocious language and unusually large vocabularies but have great difficulty in sustaining typical conversations the give and take of non autistic conversation is hard for them although they often carry on a monologue on a favorite subject giving no one else an opportunity to comment when given the chance to converse with other autistics they comfortably do so in parallel monologue taking turns expressing views and information just as neurotypicals people without autism have trouble understanding autistic body languages vocal tones or phraseology people with autism similarly have trouble with such things in people without autism in particular autistic language abilities tend to be highly literal people without autism often inappropriately attribute hidden meaning to what people with autism say or expect the person with autism to sense such unstated meaning in their own words the body language of people with autism can be difficult for other people to understand facial expressions movements and gestures may be easily understood by some other people with autism but do not match those used by other people also their tone of voice has a much more subtle inflection in reflecting their feelings and the auditory system of a person without autism often cannot sense the fluctuations what seems to non autistic people like a high pitched sing song or flat robot like voice is common in autistic children some autistic children with relatively good language skills speak like little adults rather than communicating at their current age level which is one of the things that can lead to problems since non autistic people are often unfamiliar with the autistic body language and since autistic natural language may not tend towards speech autistic people often struggle to let other people know what they need as anybody might do in such a situation they may scream in frustration or resort to grabbing what they want while waiting for non autistic people to learn to communicate with them people with autism do whatever they can to get through to them communication difficulties may contribute to autistic people becoming socially anxious or depressed repetitive behaviors although people with autism usually appear physically normal and have good muscle control unusual repetitive motions known as self stimulation or stimming may set them apart these behaviors might be extreme and highly apparent or more subtle some children and older individuals spend a lot of time repeatedly flapping their arms or wiggling their toes others suddenly freeze in position as children they might spend hours lining up their cars and trains in a certain way not using them for pretend play if someone accidentally moves one of these toys the child may be tremendously upset autistic children often need and demand absolute consistency in their environment a slight change in any routine in mealtimes dressing taking a bath or going to school at a certain time and by the same route can be extremely disturbing people with autism sometimes have a persistent intense preoccupation for example the child might be obsessed with learning all about vacuum cleaners train schedules or lighthouses often they show great interest in different languages numbers symbols or science topics repetitive behaviors can also extend into the spoken word as well perseveration of a single word or phrase even for a specific number of times can also become a part of the child s daily routine effects in education children with autism are affected with these symptoms every day these unusual characteristics set them apart from the everyday normal student because they have trouble understanding people s thoughts and feelings they have trouble understanding what their teacher may be telling them they do not understand that facial expressions and vocal variations hold meanings and may misinterpret what emotion their instructor is displaying this inability to fully decipher the world around them makes education stressful teachers need to be aware of a student s disorder so that they are able to help the student get the best out of the lessons being taught some students learn better with visual aids as they are better able to understand material presented this way because of this many teachers create visual schedules for their autistic students this allows the student to know what is going on throughout the day so they know what to prepare for and what activity they will be doing next some autistic children have trouble going from one activity to the next so this visual schedule can help to reduce stress research has shown that working in pairs may be beneficial to autistic children autistic students have problems in schools not only with language and communication but with socialization as well they feel self conscious about themselves and many feel that they will always be outcasts by allowing them to work with peers they can make friends which in turn can help them cope with the problems that arise by doing so they can become more integrated into the mainstream environment of the classroom a teacher s aide can also be useful to the student the aide is able to give more elaborate directions that the teacher may not have time to explain to the autistic child the aide can also facilitate the autistic child in such a way as to allow them to stay at a similar level to the rest of the class this allows a partially one on one lesson structure so that the child is still able to stay in a normal classroom but be given the extra help that they need there are many different techniques that teachers can use to assist their students a teacher needs to become familiar with the child s disorder to know what will work best with that particular child every child is going to be different and teachers have to be able to adjust with every one of them students with autism spectrum disorders typically have high levels of anxiety and stress particularly in social environments like school if a student exhibits aggressive or explosive behavior it is important for educational teams to recognize the impact of stress and anxiety preparing students for new situations by writing social stories can lower anxiety teaching social and emotional concepts using systematic teaching approaches such as the incredible five point scale or other cognitive behavioral strategies can increase a student s ability to control excessive behavioral reactions dsm definition autism is defined in section two nine nine zero zero of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm iv as a total of six or more items from one two and three with at least two from one and one each from two and three qualitative impairment in social interaction as manifested by at least two of the following marked impairment in the use of multiple nonverbal behaviors such as eye to eye gaze facial expression body postures and gestures to regulate social interaction failure to develop peer relationships appropriate to developmental level a lack of spontaneous seeking to share enjoyment interests or achievements with other people e g by a lack of showing bringing or pointing out objects of interest lack of social or emotional reciprocity qualitative impairments in communication as manifested by at least one of the following delay in or total lack of the development of spoken language not accompanied by an attempt to compensate through alternative modes of communication such as gesture or mime in individuals with adequate speech marked impairment in the ability to initiate or sustain a conversation with others stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language lack of varied spontaneous make believe play or social imitative play appropriate to developmental level restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior interests and activities as manifested by at least one of the following encompassing preoccupation with one or more stereotyped and restricted patterns of interest that is abnormal either in intensity or focus apparently inflexible adherence to specific nonfunctional routines or rituals stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms e g hand or finger flapping or twisting or complex whole body movements persistent preoccupation with parts of objects delays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following areas with onset prior to age three years one social interaction two language as used in social communication or three symbolic or imaginative play the disturbance is not better accounted for by rett s disorder or childhood disintegrative disorder the diagnostic and statistical manual s diagnostic criteria in general is controversial for being vague and subjective see the dsm cautionary statement the criteria for autism is much more controversial and some clinicians today may ignore it completely instead solely relying on other methods for determining the diagnosis types of autism autism presents in a wide degree from those who are nearly dysfunctional and apparently mentally handicapped to those whose symptoms are mild or remedied enough to appear unexceptional normal to the general public in terms of both classification and therapy autistic individuals are often divided into those with an iq eight zero are referred to as having high functioning autism hfa low and high functioning are more generally applied to how well an individual can accomplish activities of daily living rather than to iq the terms low and high functioning are controversial and not all autistics accept these labels further these two labels are not currently used or accepted in autism literature this discrepancy can lead to confusion among service providers who equate iq with functioning and may refuse to serve high iq autistic people who are severely compromised in their ability to perform daily living tasks or may fail to recognize the intellectual potential of many autistic people who are considered lfa for example some professionals refuse to recognize autistics who can speak or write as being autistic at all because they still think of autism as a communication disorder so severe that no speech or writing is possible as a consequence many high functioning autistic persons and autistic people with a relatively high iq are underdiagnosed thus making the claim that autism implies retardation self fulfilling the number of people diagnosed with lfa is not rising quite as sharply as hfa indicating that at least part of the explanation for the apparent rise is probably better diagnostics asperger s and kanner s syndrome asperger described his patients as little professors in the current diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm iv tr the most significant difference between autistic disorder kanner s and asperger s syndrome is that a diagnosis of the former includes the observation of delays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following areas with onset prior to age three years one social interaction two language as used in social communication or three symbolic or imaginative play while a diagnosis of asperger s syndrome observes no clinically significant delay in these areas the dsm makes no mention of level of intellectual functioning but the fact that asperger s autistics as a group tend to perform better than those with kanner s autism has produced a popular conception that asperger s syndrome is synonymous with higher functioning autism or that it is a lesser disorder than autism there is also a popular but not necessarily true conception that all autistic individuals with a high level of intellectual functioning have asperger s autism or that both types are merely geeks with a medical label attached also autism has evolved in the public understanding but the popular identification of autism with relatively severe cases as accurately depicted in rain man has encouraged relatives of family members diagnosed in the autistic spectrum to speak of their loved ones as having asperger s syndrome rather than autism autism as a spectrum disorder another view of these disorders is that they are on a continuum known as autistic spectrum disorders a related continuum is sensory integration dysfunction which is about how well we integrate the information we receive from our senses autism asperger s syndrome and sensory integration dysfunction are all closely related and overlap there are two main manifestations of classical autism regressive autism and early infantile autism early infantile autism is present at birth while regressive autism begins before the age of three and often around one eight months although this causes some controversy over when the neurological differences involved in autism truly begin some believe that it is only a matter of when an environmental toxin triggers the disorder this triggering could occur during gestation due to a toxin that enters the mother s body and is transfered to the fetus the triggering could also occur after birth during the crucial early nervous system development of the child due to a toxin directly entering the child s body increase in diagnoses of autism the number of reported cases of autism has increased dramatically over the past decade statistics in graph from the national center for health statistics there has been an explosion worldwide in reported cases of autism over the last ten years which is largely reminiscent of increases in the diagnosis of schizophrenia and multiple personality disorder in the twentieth century this has brought rise to a number of different theories as to the nature of the sudden increase epidemiologists argue that the rise in diagnoses in the united states is partly or entirely attributable to changes in diagnostic criteria reclassifications public awareness and the incentive to receive federally mandated services a widely cited study from the m i n d institute in california one seven october two zero zero two claimed that the increase in autism is real even after those complicating factors are accounted for see reference in this section below other researchers remain unconvinced see references below including dr chris johnson a professor of pediatrics at the university of texas health sciences center at san antonio and cochair of the american academy of pediatrics autism expert panel who says there is a chance we re seeing a true rise but right now i don t think anybody can answer that question for sure newsweek reference below the answer to this question has significant ramifications on the direction of research since a real increase would focus more attention and research funding on the search for environmental factors while little or no real increase would focus more attention to genetics on the other hand it is conceivable that certain environmental factors vaccination diet societal changes may have a particular impact on people with a specific genetic constitution there is little public research on the effects of in vitro fertilization on the number of incidences of autism one of the more popular theories is that there is a connection between geekdom and autism this is hinted for instance by a wired magazine article in two zero zero one entitled the geek syndrome which is a point argued by many in the autism rights movement this article many professionals assert is just one example of the media s application of mental disease labels to what is actually variant normal behavior they argue that shyness lack of athletic ability or social skills and intellectual interests even when they seem unusual to others are not in themselves signs of autism or asperger s syndrome others assert that it is actually the medical profession which is applying mental disease labels to children who in the past would have simply been accepted as a little different or even labeled gifted see clinomorphism for further discussion of this issue due to the recent publicity surrounding autism and autistic spectrum disorders an increasing number of adults are choosing to seek diagnoses of high functioning autism or asperger s syndrome in light of symptoms they currently experience or experienced during childhood since the cause of autism is thought to be at least partly genetic a proportion of these adults seek their own diagnosis specifically as follow up to their children s diagnoses because autism falls into the pervasive developmental disorder category strictly speaking symptoms must have been present in a given patient before age seven in order to make a differential diagnosis therapies sociology due to the complexity of autism there are many facets of sociology that need to be considered when discussing it such as the culture which has evolved from autistic persons connecting and communicating with one another in addition there are several subgroups forming within the autistic community sometimes in strong opposition to one another community and politics much like many other controversies in the world the autistic community itself has splintered off into several groups essentially these groups are those who seek a cure for autism dubbed pro cure those who do not desire a cure for autism and as such resist it dubbed anti cure and the many people caught in the middle of the two in recent history with scientists learning more about autism and possibly coming closer to a cure some members of the anti cure movement sent a letter to the united nations demanding to be treated as a minority group rather than a group with a mental disability or disease websites such as autistics org present the view of the anti cure group there are numerous resources available for autistics from many groups due to the fact that many autistics find it easier to communicate online than in person many of these resources are available online in addition sometimes successful autistic adults in a local community will help out children with autism much in the way a master would help out an apprentice for example two zero zero two was declared autism awareness year in the united kingdom this idea was initiated by ivan and charika corea parents of an autistic child charin autism awareness year was led by the british institute of brain injured children disabilities trust national autistic society autism london and eight zero zero organizations in the united kingdom it had the personal backing of british prime minister tony blair and parliamentarians of all parties in the palace of westminster culture with the recent increases in autism recognition and new approaches to educating and socializing autistics an autistic culture has begun to develop similar to deaf culture autistic culture is based in a belief that autism is a unique way of being and not a disorder to be cured there are some commonalities which are specific to autism in general as a culture not just autistic culture it is a common misperception that people with autism do not marry many do get married often they marry another person with autism although this is not always the case many times autistics are attracted to other autistics due to shared interests or obsessions but more often than not the attraction is due to simple compatibility with personality types the same as is true for non autistics autistics who communicate have explained that companionship is as important to autistics as it is to anyone else multigenerational autistic families have also recently become a bit more common the interests of autistic people and so called geeks or nerds can often overlap as autistic people can sometimes become preoccupied with certain subjects much like the variant normal behavior geeks experience however in practice many autistic people have difficulty with working in groups which impairs them even in the most technical of situations autistic adults temple grandin one of the more successful adults with autism photograph courtesy joshua nathaniel pritikin and william lawrence jarrold some autistic adults are able to work successfully in mainstream jobs usually those with high functioning autism or asperger s syndrome nevertheless communication and social problems often cause difficulties in many areas of the autistic s life other autistics are capable of employment in sheltered workshops under the supervision of managers trained in working with persons with disabilities a nurturing environment at home at school and later in job training and at work helps autistic people continue to learn and to develop throughout their lives some argue that the internet allows autistic individuals to communicate and form online communities in addition to being able to find occupations such as independent consulting which does generally not require much human interaction offline in the united states the public schools responsibility for providing services ends when the autistic person is in their two zero s depending on each state the family is then faced with the challenge of finding living arrangements and employment to match the particular needs of their adult child as well as the programs and facilities that can provide support services to achieve these goals autistic savants the autistic savant phenomenon is sometimes seen in autistic people the term is used to describe a person who is autistic and has extreme talent in a certain area of study although there is a common association between savants and autism an association created by the one nine eight eight film rain man most autistic people are not savants mental calculators and fast programming skills are the most common form the famous example is daniel tammet the subject of the documentary film the brain man kim peek one of the inspirations for dustin hoffman s character in the film rain man is not autistic bright splinters of the mind is a book that explores this issue further other pervasive developmental disorders autism and asperger s syndrome are just two of the five pervasive developmental disorders pdds the three other pervasive developmental disorders are rett syndrome childhood disintegrative disorder and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified some of these are related to autism while some of them are entirely separate conditions rett syndrome rett syndrome is relatively rare affecting almost exclusively females one out of one zero zero zero zero to one five zero zero zero after a period of normal development sometime between six and one eight months autism like symptoms begin to appear the little girl s mental and social development regresses she no longer responds to her parents and pulls away from any social contact if she has been talking she stops she cannot control her feet she wrings her hands some of these early symptoms may be confused for autism some of the problems associated with rett syndrome can be treated physical occupational and speech therapy can help with problems of coordination movement and speech scientists sponsored by the national institute of child health and human development have discovered that a mutation in the sequence of a single gene causes rett syndrome and can physically test for it with a eight zero accuracy rate rett syndrome in the past was sometimes classified as an autistic spectrum disorder however most scientists agree that rett syndrome is a separate developmental disorder and not part of the autistic spectrum childhood disintegrative disorder childhood disintegrative disorder cdd and sometimes abbreviated as chdd also is a condition appearing in three or four year old children who have developed normally until age two over several months the child will deteriorate in intellectual social and language functioning from previously normal behaviour this long period of normal development before regression helps differentiate cdd from rett syndrome and in fact it must be differentiated from autism in testing the cause for cdd is unknown thus it may be a spectrum disorder but current evidence suggests it has something to do with the central nervous system pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified or pdd nos is referred to as a subthreshold condition because it is a classification which is given to someone who suffers from impairments in social interaction communication and or stereotyped behaviour but does not meet the criteria for one of the other four pervasive developmental disorders unlike the other four pervasive developmental disorders pdd nos has no specific guidelines for diagnosis so the person may have a lot of characteristics of an autistic person or few to none at all note that pervasive developmental disorder is not a diagnosis just a term to refer to the five mentioned conditions while pdd nos is an official diagnosis see also general autism therapies causes of autism conditions comorbid to autism spectrum disorders early

public autism resource information service directory of uk autism services autism spectrum quotient measure your autism spectrum quotient aspie quiz quiz that measures autistic traits autism childhood psychiatric disorders disability communication disorders mental illness diagnosis by dsm and iscdrhp neurological disorders albedo is the measure of reflectivity of a surface or body it is the ratio of electromagnetic radiation em radiation reflected to the amount incident upon it the fraction usually expressed as a percentage from zero to one zero zero is an important concept in climatology and astronomy this ratio depends on the frequency of the radiation considered unqualified it refers to an average across the spectrum of visible light it also depends on the angle of incidence of the radiation unqualified normal incidence fresh snow albedos are high up to nine zero the ocean surface has a low albedo the average albedo of earth is about three zero whereas the albedo of the moon is about seven in astronomy the albedo of satellites and asteroids can be used to infer surface composition most notably ice content enceladus a moon of saturn has the highest known albedo of any body in the solar system with nine nine of em radiation reflected human activities have changed the albedo via forest clearance and farming for example of various areas around the globe however quantification of this effect is difficult on the global scale it is not clear whether the changes have tended to increase or decrease global warming the classical example of albedo effect is the snow temperature feedback if a snow covered area warms and the snow melts the albedo decreases more sunlight is absorbed and the temperature tends to increase the converse is true if snow forms a cooling cycle happens the intensity of the albedo effect depends on the size of the change in albedo and the amount of insolation for this reason it can be potentially very large in the tropics some examples of albedo effects fairbanks alaska according to the national climatic data center s ghcn two data which is composed of three zero year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather stations across the world the college weather station at fairbanks alaska is about three c five f warmer than the airport at fairbanks partly because of drainage patterns but also largely because of the lower albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of pine trees and therefore less open snowy ground to reflect the heat back into space neunke and kukla have shown that this difference is especially marked during the late winter months when solar radiation is greater the tropics although the albedo temperature effect is most famous in colder regions of earth because more snow falls there it is actually much stronger in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more sunlight when brazilian ranchers cut down dark tropical rainforest trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to grow crops the average temperature of the area appears to increase by an average of about three c five f year round which is a significant amount small scale effects albedo works on a smaller scale too people who wear dark clothes in the summertime put themselves at a greater risk of heatstroke than those who wear white clothes pine forests the albedo of a pine forest at four five n in the winter in which the trees cover the land surface completely is only about nine among the lowest of any naturally occurring land environment this is partly due to the color of the pines and partly due to multiple scattering of sunlight within the trees which lowers the overall reflected light level due to light penetration the ocean s albedo is even lower at about three five though this depends strongly on the angle of the incident radiation dense swampland averages between nine and one four deciduous trees average about one three a grassy field usually comes in at about two zero a barren field will depend on the color of the soil and can be as low as five or as high as four zero with one five being about the average for farmland a desert or large beach usually averages around two five but varies depending on the color of the sand reference edward walker s study in the great plains in the winter around four five n urban areas urban areas in particular have very unnatural values for albedo because of the many human built structures which absorb light before the light can reach the surface in the northern part of the world cities are relatively dark and walker has shown that their average albedo is about seven with only a slight increase during the summer in most tropical countries cities average around one two this is similar to the values found in northern suburban transitional zones part of the reason for this is the different natural environment of cities in tropical regions e g there are more very dark trees around another reason is that portions of the tropics are very poor and city buildings must be built with different materials warmer regions may also choose lighter colored building materials so the structures will remain cooler trees because trees tend to have a low albedo removing forests would tend to increase albedo and thereby cool the planet cloud feedbacks further complicate the issue in seasonally snow covered zones winter albedos of treeless areas are one zero to five zero higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily studies by the hadley centre have investigated the relative generally warming effect of albedo change and cooling effect of carbon sequestration on planting forests they found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool new forests in high latitudes e g siberia were neutral or perhaps warming snow snow albedos can be as high as nine zero this is for the ideal example however fresh deep snow over a featureless landscape over antarctica they average a little more than eight zero if a marginally snow covered area warms snow tends to melt lowering the albedo and hence leading to more snowmelt the ice albedo feedback this is the basis for predictions of enhanced warming in the polar and seasonally snow covered regions as a result of global warming clouds clouds are another source of albedo that play into the global warming equation different types of clouds have different albedo values theoretically ranging from a minimum of near zero to a maximum in the high seven zero s climate models have shown that if the whole earth were to be suddenly covered by white clouds the surface temperatures would drop to a value of about one five zero c two four zero f this model though it is far from perfect also predicts that to offset a five c nine f temperature change due to an increase in the magnitude of the greenhouse effect all we would need to do is increase the earth s overall albedo by about one two by adding more white clouds albedo and climate in some areas are already affected by artificial clouds such as those created by the contrails of heavy commercial airliner traffic a study following the september one one attacks

country the letter a is the first letter in the latin alphabet its name in english is a plural aes a s or as history the letter a probably started as a pictogram of an ox head in egyptian hieroglyphs or the proto semitic alphabet by one six zero zero bc the phoenician alphabet s letter had a linear form that served as the basis for all later forms its name must have corresponded closely to the hebrew aleph the name is also similar to the arabic alif when the ancient greeks adopted the alphabet they had no use for the glottal stop that the letter had denoted in phoenician and other semitic languages so they used the sign for the vowel and changed its name to alpha in the earliest greek inscriptions dating to the eight th century bc the letter rests upon its side but in the greek alphabet of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg or by the angle at which the cross line is set the etruscans brought the greek alphabet to what was italy and left the letter unchanged the romans later adopted the etruscan alphabet to write latin and the resulting letter was preserved in the modern latin alphabet used to write many languages including english the letter has two minuscule lower case forms the form used in most current handwriting consists of a circle and vertical stroke most printed material uses a form consisting of a small loop with an arc over it both derive from the majuscule capital form in greek handwriting it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into a single loop as demonstrated by the uncial version below many fonts then made the right leg vertical in some of these the serif that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc

latinized from this ancient greek to achilles appearing in etruscan as achle was a hero ancient greek heros defender of the trojan war the greatest and the most central character of homer s iliad name the very first two lines of the iliad read transliterated m nin aeide thea p l iade akhil os oulomen n h muri akhaiois alge eth ken translated sing muse the wrath of achilles the son of peleus the destructive wrath that brought countless griefs upon the achaeans statue of achillesin these lines we see the name akhilleus peleides which is a praenomen and a patronymic the latter being formed from peleus with the suffix ides producing achilles the son of peleus the system is similar to the names used by scandinavians before modern times such as leif erikson achilles name can be analyzed as a combination of akhos grief and laos a people tribe nation etc in other words achilles is an embodiment of the grief of the people grief being a theme raised numerous times in the iliad frequently by achilles achilles role as the hero of grief forms an ironic juxtaposition with the conventional view of achilles as the hero of kleos glory usually glory in war laos has been construed by gregory nagy following leonard palmer to mean a corps of soldiers with this derivation the name would have a double meaning in the poem when the hero is functioning rightly his men bring grief to the enemy but when wrongly his men get the grief the poem is in part about the misdirection of anger on the part of leadership birth achilles was the son of the mortal peleus king of the myrmidons in phthia southeast thessaly and the sea nymph thetis zeus and poseidon had been rivals for the hand of thetis until prometheus the fire bringer prophesized that thetis would bear a son greater than his father for this reason the two gods withdrew their pursuit and had her wed to peleus when achilles was born according to the most common version of the myth thetis tried to make him immortal by dipping him in the river styx but she forgot to wet the heel she held him by leaving him vulnerable at that spot see achilles tendon in an earlier and less popular version of the story thetis anointed the boy in ambrosia and put him on top of a fire to burn away the mortal parts of his body she was interrupted by peleus and abandoned both father and son in a rage homer does not make reference to this invulnerability in the iliad to the contrary he mentions achilles being wounded although not seriously peleus gave him together with his young friend or lover patroclus to chiron the centaur on mt pelion to be raised achilles in the trojan war telephus when the greeks left for the trojan war they accidentally stopped in mysia ruled by king telephus in the resulting battle achilles gave telephus a wound that would not heal telephus consulted an oracle who stated that he that wounded shall heal according to other reports in euripides lost play about telephus he went to aulis pretending to be a beggar and asked achilles to heal his wound achilles refused claiming to have no medical knowledge alternatively telephus held orestes for ransom the ransom being achilles aid in healing the wound odysseus reasoned that the spear had inflicted the wound therefore the spear must be able to heal it pieces of the spear were scraped off onto the wound and telephus was healed this is an example of sympathetic magic during the trojan war the rage of achilles by giovanni battista tiepolo in homer s iliad achilles is the only mortal to experience consuming rage menon his anger is at some times wavering at other times absolute the humanization of achilles by the events of the war is an important theme of the iliad achilles charioteer s name was automedon troilus according to dares phrygius account of the destruction of troy while troilus the youngest son of priam and hecuba whom some say was fathered by apollo was watering his horses at the lion fountain outside the walls of troy achilles saw him and fell in love with his beauty whose loveliness of form was described by ibycus as being like gold thrice refined the youth rejected his advances and took refuge inside the temple of apollo achilles pursued him into the sanctuary and decapitated him on the god s own altar tzetzes scholiast on lycophron at the time troilus was said to be a year short of his twentieth birthday and the legend goes that if troilus had lived to be twenty troy would have been invincible first vatican mythographer agamemnon and the death of patroclus patroclus and achilles achilles bandages the arm of his friend patroclus the latter turns his head aside to avoid the sight of blood and of achilles noticing his pain grimaces the scene has been interpreted as an act of welfare and comradeship or as a scene with sexual overtones ancient greek culture often held the two to be lovers achilles took two three towns outside troy including lyrnessos where he captured briseis to keep as a concubine meanwhile agamemnon took a woman named chryseis and taunted her father chryses a priest of apollo when he attempted to buy her back apollo sent a plague through the greek armies and agamemnon was forced to give chryseis back to her father however he took briseis away from achilles as compensation for his loss this action sparked the central plot of the iliad achilles becomes enraged and refuses to fight for the greeks any further the war goes badly through the influence of zeus and the greeks offer handsome reparations to their greatest warrior after the greeks are pushed back to the ships which are just starting to be set on fire by the trojan hero hector achilles is visited by odysseus ajax and phoenix who attempt to persuade him to return to battle achilles still refuses to fight but agrees to allow patroclus to fight in his place wearing his armor the next day patroclus is killed and stripped of the armor by hector who mistakes him for achilles achilles is overwhelmed with grief for his beloved friend and the rage he once harbored toward agamemnon begins shifting to hector thetis his mother rises from the sea floor and sympathizes with his grief she obtains magnificent new armor for him from hephaestus the goddess athena provides him with the aegis of zeus when he goes to the battlefield the entire trojan army flees behind the walls of troy achilles wrath is terrible and he slays many trojan warriors and allies including priam s son lycaon whom achilles had previously captured and sold into slavery but who had been returned to troy eventually hector comes out of the walls to defend the honour of troy he asked achilles to agree that the body of the loser would be returned for proper burial by the winner achilles rejected this arrangement saying though twenty ransoms and thy weight in gold were offered i would refuse it all stories tell that hector ran about troy seven times and achilles followed him however seeing that achilles would not be outrun hector stood his ground and fought other versions of the tale say that achilles chased after hector two times and one time he was delivered by the gods however on their second encounter achilles trapped hector and challenged him after a legendary fight achilles kills hector influenced by his anger he drags the body of hector behind his chariot round the walls of troy three times and refuses to allow it to receive funeral rites much to the dismay of achilles the body of hector miraculously heals and will not decay as normally expected aphrodite the goddess of love who sided with troy throughout the whole conflict put a protective barrier over hector which kept him looking like he did before he was viciously killed by achilles when priam the king of troy and hector s father comes secretly into the greek camp to plead for the body achilles finally relents in one of the most moving scenes of the iliad he receives priam graciously and allows him to take the body away the scene is intensely moving because priam the king of one of the greatest cities in the known world kneels down old and frail as he is and kisses the hands of the man who killed his son the greatness of achilles lies in not just being the greatest greek fighter ever but in knowing the choice provided to him by destiny his mother thetis had prophesied to him that if he pulled out of the trojan war he would enjoy a long and a happy life if achilles fought however he would die before the walls of troy but assure an everlasting glory surpassing that of all other heroes he had made the choice and coming face to face with it showed his greatness xanthos during the trojan war xanthos one of achilles horses was rebuked by achilles for allowing patroclus to be killed xanthos responded by saying hera temporarily gave him voice to do so that a god and a mortal had killed patroclus and a god and a mortal would soon kill achilles too memnon cycnus penthesilea and the death of achilles thetis rising from the sea to comfort achilles book one eight by thomas banks english one seven seven eight victoria and albert museum shortly after the death of hector achilles defeated memnon of ethiopia cycnus of colonae and the amazonian warrior penthesilia with whom achilles also had an affair in some versions as predicted by hector with his dying breath achilles was thereafter killed by paris either by an arrow to the heel which may have subsequently become fatally infected and is said to have been guided by apollo or in an older version by a knife to the back while visiting polyxena a princess of troy both versions conspicuously deny the killer any sort of valor and achilles remains undefeated on the battlefield paris was later killed by philoctetes using the enormous bow of heracles his bones are mingled with those of patroclus and funeral games are held like ajax he is represented although not by homer as living after his death in the island of leuke at the mouth of the danube the fate of achilles armor achilles armor was the object of a feud between odysseus and ajax the greater achilles older cousin they competed for it and odysseus won ajax went mad with grief and vowed to kill his comrades he started killing cattle thinking they were greek soldiers and then himself other stories about achilles some post homeric sources claim that in order to keep achilles safe from the war thetis or in some versions peleus hid the young man at the court of lycomedes king of skyros there achilles was disguised as a girl and lived among lycomedes daughters under the name pyrrha the red haired girl with lycomedes daughter deidamia achilles fathered a son neoptolemus also called pyrrhus after his father s alias according to this story odysseus learned from the prophet calchas that the achaeans would be unable to capture troy without achilles aid he went to skyros in the guise of a peddler selling women s clothes and jewelry but placed a shield and spear among his goods when achilles instantly took up the spear odysseus saw through his disguise and convinced him to join the trojan campaign in another version of the story odysseus arranged for a trumpet alarm to be sounded while he was with lycomedes women while the women fled in panic achilles prepared to defend the court thus giving his identity away the story about achilles in drag is not found in homer in homer s odyssey there is a passage in which odysseus sails to the underworld and converses with the shades one of these is achilles who when greeted as blessed in life blessed in death responds that he would rather be a slave than be dead this has been interpreted as a rejection of his warrior life but also as indignity to his martyrdom being slighted the kings of epirus claimed to be descended from achilles through his son alexander the great son of the epiran princess olympias could therefore also claim this descent and in many ways strove to be like his great ancestor he is said to have visited his tomb while passing troy achilles was worshipped as a sea god in many of the greek colonies on the black sea the homosexual relationship between achilles and patroclus is something much explored in post homeric literature by the fifth and fourth centuries the deep and arguably ambiguous friendship portrayed in homer blossomed into an unequivocal love affair in the works of aeschylus plato and aeschines and seems to have inspired the enigmatic verses in lycophron s third century alexandra that claim achilles slayed troilus in a matter of unrequited love achilles fought and killed the amazon helene some also said he married medea and that after both their deaths they were united in the elysian fields of hades as hera promised thetis in apollonius

five one eight six five sometimes called abe lincoln and nicknamed honest abe the rail splitter and the great emancipator was the one six th president of the united states one eight six one to one eight six five and the first president from the republican party lincoln opposed the expansion of slavery and oversaw the union war effort during the american civil war he selected the generals and approved their strategy selected senior civilian officials supervised diplomacy patronage and party affairs rallied public opinion through messages and speeches such as the gettysburg address and took personal charge of plans for the abolition of slavery and the reconstruction of the union he was assassinated as the war ended by john wilkes booth role in history president lincoln was opposed to what he saw as the slave power and staunchly opposed its efforts to expand slavery into federal territories his victory in the one eight six zero presidential election further polarized an already divided nation before his inauguration in march of one eight six one seven southern states seceded from the united states formed the confederate states of america and took control of u s forts and other properties within their boundaries these events soon led to the american civil war lincoln is often praised for his work as a wartime leader who proved adept at balancing competing considerations and at getting rival groups to work together toward a common goal lincoln had to negotiate between radical and moderate republican leaders who were often far apart on the issues while attempting to win support from war democrats and loyalists in the seceding states he personally directed the war effort in close cooperation one eight six four six five with general ulysses s grant which ultimately led the union forces to victory over the confederacy his leadership qualities were evident in his diplomatic handling of the border slave states at the beginning of the fighting in his defeat of a congressional attempt to reorganize his cabinet in one eight six two in his many speeches and writings which helped mobilize and inspire the north and in his defusing of the peace issue in the one eight six four presidential campaign copperheads vehemently criticized him for violating the constitution overstepping the bounds of executive power refusing to compromise on slavery declaring martial law suspending habeas corpus ordering the arrest of thousands of public officials and a number of newspaper publishers and killing hundreds of thousands of young men radical republicans criticized him for going too slow on abolition of slavery and not being ruthless enough toward the conquered south lincoln is most famous for his roles in preserving the union and ending slavery in the united states with the emancipation proclamation and the thirteenth amendment to the united states constitution however some abolitionists criticized him for only freeing the slaves under the confederacy in one eight six three and waiting until one eight six five to free slaves held in the union historians have argued that lincoln had a lasting influence on u s political and social institutions importantly setting a precedent for greater centralization of powers in the federal government and the weakening of the powers of the individual state governments lincoln spent most of his attention on military matters and politics but with his strong support his administration established the current system of national banks with the national bank act he increased the tariff to raise revenue and encourage factories imposed the first income tax issued hundreds of millions of dollars of bonds and greenbacks encouraged immigration from europe built the transcontinental railroad set up the department of agriculture encouraged farm ownership with the homestead act of one eight six two and set up the modern system of state universities with the morrill land grant colleges act during the war his treasury department effectively controlled all cotton trade in the occupied south the most dramatic incursion of federal controls on the economy during his administration west virginia and nevada were admitted as states lincoln is usually ranked as one of the greatest presidents because of his roles in destroying slavery redefining national values and saving the union his assassination made him a martyr to millions of americans however others considered him an unconstitutional tyrant for declaring martial law suspending civil liberties habeas corpus and the first amendment and ordering the arrest of thousands of public officials and newspaper publishers early life abraham lincoln was born on february one two one eight zero nine in a one room log cabin on the three four eight acre one four km sinking spring farm in the southeast part of hardin county kentucky then considered the frontier now part of larue co in nolin creek three miles five km south of hodgenville to thomas lincoln and nancy hanks lincoln was named after his deceased grandfather who was scalped in one seven eight six in an indian raid he had no middle name lincoln s parents were uneducated illiterate farmers when lincoln became famous reporters and storytellers often exaggerated the poverty and obscurity of his birth however lincoln s father thomas was a respected and relatively affluent citizen of the kentucky backcountry he had purchased the sinking spring farm in december one eight zero eight for two zero zero cash and assumption of a debt his parents belonged to a baptist church that had pulled away from a larger church because they refused to support slavery from a very young age lincoln was exposed to anti slavery sentiment however he never joined his parents church or any other church and as a youth ridiculed religion three years after purchasing the property a prior land claim filed in hardin circuit court forced the lincolns to move thomas continued legal action until he lost the case in one eight one five legal expenses contributed to family difficulties in one eight one one they were able to lease three zero acres zero one km of a two three zero acre zero nine km farm on knob creek a few miles away where they then moved in a valley of the rolling fork river this was some of the best farmland in the area at this time lincoln s father was a respected community member and a successful farmer and carpenter lincoln s earliest recollections are from this farm in one eight one five another claimant sought to eject the family from the knob creek farm frustrated with litigation and lack of security provided by kentucky courts thomas decided to move to indiana which had been surveyed by the federal government making land titles more secure it is possible that these episodes motivated abraham to later learn surveying and become an attorney in one eight one six when lincoln was seven years old he and his parents moved to spencer county indiana he would state partly on account of slavery and partly because of economic difficulties in kentucky in one eight one eight lincoln s mother died of milk sickness at age thirty four when abe was nine soon afterwards lincoln s father remarried to sarah bush johnston sarah lincoln raised young lincoln like one of her own children years later she compared lincoln to her own son saying both were good boys but i must say both now being dead that abe was the best boy i ever saw or ever expect to see lincoln by david herbert donald one nine nine five in one eight three zero after more economic and land title difficulties in indiana the family settled on government land on a site selected by lincoln s father in macon county illinois the following winter was especially brutal and the family nearly moved back to indiana when his father relocated the family to a nearby site the following year the two two year old lincoln struck out on his own canoeing down the sangamon to sangamon county illinois now in menard county in the village of new salem later that year hired by new salem businessman denton offutt and accompanied by friends he took goods from new salem to new orleans via flatboat on the sangamon illinois and mississippi rivers while in new orleans he may have witnessed a slave auction that left an indelible impression on him for the rest of his life whether he actually witnessed a slave auction at that time or not living in a country with a considerable slave presence he probably saw similar atrocities from time to time his formal education consisted of perhaps one eight months of schooling from itinerant teachers in effect he was self educated studying every book he could borrow he mastered the bible shakespeare english history and american history and developed a plain style that puzzled audiences more used to orotund oratory he avoided hunting and fishing because he did not like killing animals even for food and though unusually tall and strong spent so much time reading that some neighbors thought he must be doing it to avoid strenuous manual labor he was skilled with an axe they called him the rail splitter and a good wrestler young abraham lincoln early career lincoln began his political career in one eight three two at the age of two three with a campaign for the illinois general assembly as a member of the whig party the centerpiece of his platform was the undertaking of navigational improvements on the sangamon river in the hopes of attracting steamboat traffic to the river which would allow sparsely populated poor areas along and near the river to grow and prosper he served as a captain in a company of the illinois militia drawn from new salem during the black hawk war although he never saw combat he wrote after being elected by his peers that he had not had any such success in life which gave him so much satisfaction he later tried and failed at several small time business ventures he held an illinois state liquor license and sold whiskey finally after coming across the second volume of sir william blackstone s four volume commentaries on the laws of england he taught himself the law and was admitted to the illinois bar in one eight three seven that same year he moved to springfield illinois and began to practice law with stephen t logan he became one of the most respected and successful lawyers in the prairie state and grew steadily more prosperous lincoln served four successive terms in the illinois house of representatives as a representative from sangamon county beginning in one eight three four he became a leader of the whig party in the legislature in one eight three seven he made his first protest against slavery in the illinois house stating that the institution was founded on both injustice and bad policy lincoln shared a bed with joshua fry speed from one eight three seven to one eight four one in springfield while many historians claim it was not uncommon in the mid one nine th century for men to share a bed just as two men today may share a house or an apartment gay activist c a tripp generated controversy with his two zero zero five book the intimate world of abraham lincoln which suggested their relationship may also have been sexual in one eight four one lincoln entered law practice with william herndon a fellow whig in one eight five six both men joined the fledgling republican party following lincoln s assassination herndon began collecting stories about lincoln from those who knew him in central illinois eventually publishing a book herndon s lincoln lincoln never joined an antislavery society and denied he supported the abolitionists he married into a prominent slave owning family from kentucky and allowed his children to spend time there surrounded by slaves several of his in laws became confederate officers he greatly admired the science that flourished in new england and was perhaps the only father in illinois at the time to send his son robert todd lincoln to elite eastern schools phillips exeter academy and harvard college marriage on november four one eight four two at the age of three three lincoln married mary todd the couple had four sons robert todd lincoln b august one one eight four three in springfield illinois d july two six one nine two six in manchester vermont edward baker

illinois only robert survived into adulthood of robert s three children only jessie lincoln had any children two mary lincoln beckwith and robert todd lincoln beckwith neither robert beckwith nor mary beckwith had any children so abraham lincoln s bloodline ended when robert beckwith lincoln s great grandson died on december two four one nine eight five illinois politics lincoln in one eight four six or one eight four seven in one eight four six lincoln was elected to one term in the u s house of representatives a staunch whig lincoln often referred to party leader henry clay as his political idol as a freshman house member lincoln was not a particularly powerful or influential figure in congress he used his office as an opportunity to speak out against the war with mexico which he attributed to president polk s desire for military glory that attractive rainbow that rises in showers of blood lincoln was a key early supporter of zachary taylor s candidacy for the one eight four eight whig presidential nomination when lincoln s term ended the incoming taylor administration offered him the governorship of remote oregon territory acceptance would end his career in the fast growing state of illinois so he declined returning instead to springfield illinois he turned most of his energies to making a living at the bar which involved extensive travel on horseback from county to county prairie lawyer by the mid one eight five zero s lincoln faced competing transportation interests both the river barges and the railroads in one eight four nine he received a patent related to buoying vessels lincoln represented the alton duff armstrong who was on trial for the murder of james preston metzker the case is famous for lincoln s use of judicial notice a rare tactic at that time to show an eyewitness had lied on the stand claiming he witnessed the crime in the moonlight lincoln produced a farmer s almanac to show that the moon on that date was at such a low angle it could not have produced enough illumination to see anything clearly based upon this evidence armstrong was acquitted republican politics one eight five four one eight six zero the kansas nebraska act of one eight five four which expressly repealed the limits on slavery s spread that had been part of the missouri compromise of one eight two zero drew lincoln back into politics illinois democrat stephen a douglas the most powerful man in the senate proposed popular sovereignty as the solution to the slavery impasse incorporating it into the kansas nebraska act douglas argued that in a democracy the people of a territory should decide whether to allow slavery or not and not have a decision imposed on them by congress it was a speech against kansas nebraska on october one six one eight five four in peoria that caused lincoln to stand out among the other free soil orators of the day he helped form the new republican party drawing on remnants of the old whig free soil liberty and democratic parties in a stirring campaign the republicans carried illinois in one eight five four and elected a senator lincoln was the obvious choice but to keep party unity he allowed the election to go to his colleague lyman trumbull in one eight five seven five eight douglas broke with president buchanan leading to a terrific fight for control of the democratic party some eastern republicans even favored the reelection of douglas in one eight five eight since he led the opposition to the administration s push for the lecompton constitution which would have admitted kansas as a slave state accepting the republican nomination for the senate in one eight five eight lincoln delivered a famous speech in which he stated a house divided against itself cannot stand i believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free i do not expect the union to be dissolved i do not expect the house to fall but i do expect it will cease to be divided it will become all one thing or all the other the speech created a lasting image of the danger of disunion due to slavery and rallied republicans across the north the one eight five eight campaign featured the lincoln douglas debates a nationally noticed discussion on the issues that threatened to split the nation in two lincoln forced douglas to propose his freeport doctrine which lost him further support among slave holders and speeded the division of the democratic party though the republican legislative candidates won more popular votes the democrats won more seats and the legislature reelected douglas to the senate nevertheless lincoln s eloquence transformed him into a national political star during the debates of one eight five eight the issue of race was often discussed during a time period when racial egalitarianism was considered politically incorrect stephen douglas would inform the crowds if you desire negro citizenship if you desire them to vote on an equality with yourselves then support mr lincoln and the black republican party who are in favor of the citizenship of the negro official records of debate on the defensive lincoln countered that he was not in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races official records of debate historians generally remained mixed on what lincoln s actual views were on race however many tend to doubt that the highly political nature of these debates offer reliable evidence about his personal views team of rivals by doris kearns goodwin two zero zero five lincoln in text and context by donald fehrenbacher one nine eight seven as fredrick douglass observed lincoln was the first great man that i talked with in the united states freely who in no single instance reminded me of the difference between himself and myself of the difference of color life and times of fredrick douglass by fredrick douglass one eight nine five lincoln s opposition to slavery was opposition to the slave power and he was not an abolitionist in one eight five eight but the civil war changed everything and changed lincoln s beliefs in race relations as well election of one eight six zero the rail candidate political cartoon one eight six zero entering the presidential nomination process as a distinct underdog lincoln was eventually chosen as the republican candidate for the one eight six zero election for several reasons his expressed views on slavery were seen as more moderate than rivals william h seward and salmon chase his western origins also appealed to the newer states other contenders especially those with more governmental experience had acquired enemies within the party specifically seward who had run afoul of newspaperman horace greeley during the campaign lincoln was dubbed the rail splitter by republicans to emphasize the power of free labor whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts on november six one eight six zero lincoln was elected the one six th president of the united states beating democrat douglas john c breckenridge of the southern democrats and john c bell of the new constitutional union party lincoln was the first republican president he won entirely on the strength of his support in the north he was not even on the ballot in nine states in the south and won only two of nine nine six counties there lincoln gained one eight six five nine zero eight votes three nine nine of the total for one eight zero electoral votes douglas one three eight zero two zero two two nine five for one two electoral votes breckenridge eight four eight zero one nine one eight one for seven two electoral votes and bell five nine zero nine zero one one two five for three nine electoral votes there were fusion tickets in some states but even if his opponents had combined in every state lincoln had a majority vote in all but two of the states in which he won the electoral votes and would still have won the electoral college and the election secession winter one eight six zero six one as lincoln s election became more and more probable secessionists made it clear that their states would leave the union south carolina took the lead followed by six other cotton growing states georgia florida alabama mississippi louisiana and texas the upper south delaware maryland virginia north carolina tennessee kentucky missouri and arkansas listened to and rejected the secessionist appeal they decided to stay in the union though warning lincoln they would not support an invasion through their territory the seven confederate states seceded before lincoln took office declaring themselves an entirely new nation the confederate states of america president buchanan and president elect lincoln refused to recognize the confederacy president elect lincoln survived an assassination threat in baltimore and on february two three one eight six one arrived in disguise in washington at lincoln s inauguration on march four one eight six one the turners formed lincoln s bodyguard and a sizable garrison of federal troops was also present ready to protect the capital from confederate invasion or insurrection from confederates in the capital city photograph showing march four one eight six one inauguration of abraham lincoln in front of u s capitol in his first inaugural address lincoln declared i hold that in contemplation of universal law and of the constitution the union of these states is perpetual perpetuity is implied if not expressed in the fundamental law of all national governments arguing further that the purpose of the united states constitution was to form a more perfect union than the articles of confederation which were explicitly perpetual and thus the constitution too was perpetual he asked rhetorically that even were the constitution a simple contract would it not require the agreement of all parties to rescind it also in his inaugural address in a final attempt to unite the union and prevent the looming war lincoln supported the proposed corwin amendment to the constitution of which he had been a driving force it would have explicitly protected slavery in those states in which it already existed and had already passed both houses lincoln adamantly opposed the crittenden compromise however which would have permitted slavery in the territories renewing the boundary set by the missouri compromise and extending it to california despite support for this compromise among some republicans lincoln declared that were the crittenden compromise accepted it would amount to a perpetual covenant of war against every people tribe and state owning a foot of land between here and tierra del fuego because opposition to slavery expansion was the key issue uniting the republican party at the time lincoln is sometimes criticized for putting politics ahead of the national interest in refusing any compromise allowing the expansion of slavery supporters of lincoln however point out that he did not oppose slavery because he was a republican but became a republican because of his opposition to the expansion of slavery that he opposed several other republicans who were in favor of compromise and that he clearly thought his course of action was in the national interest by the time lincoln took office the confederacy was an established fact and not a single leader of that country ever proposed rejoining the union on any terms no compromise was found because no compromise was possible lincoln perhaps could have allowed the southern states to secede and some republicans recommended that however conservative democratic nationalists such as jeremiah s black joseph holt and edwin m stanton had taken control of buchanan s cabinet around january one one eight six one and refused to accept secession lincoln and nearly all republican leaders adopted this nationalistic position by march one eight six one the union could not be broken war begins one eight six one one eight six two after union troops at fort sumter were fired on and forced to surrender in april lincoln called on governors of every state to send seven five zero zero zero troops to recapture forts protect the capital and preserve the union which in his view still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states virginia which had repeatedly warned lincoln it would not allow an invasion of its territory or join an attack on another state then seceded along with north carolina tennessee and arkansas the slave states of missouri kentucky maryland and delaware did not secede and lincoln urgently negotiated with state leaders there promising not to interfere with slavery in loyal states emancipation proclamation lincoln met with his cabinet for the first reading of the emancipation proclamation draft on july two two one eight six two congress in july one eight six two moved to free the slaves by passing the second confiscation act it provided that if any person shall hereafter incite set on foot assist or engage in any rebellion or insurrection against the authority of the united states or the laws thereof or shall give aid or comfort thereto or shall engage in or give aid and comfort to any such existing rebellion or insurrection and be convicted thereof such person shall be punished by imprisonment for a period not exceeding ten years or by a fine not exceeding ten thousand dollars and by the liberation of all his slaves if any he have or by both of said punishments at the discretion of the court sec nine and be it further enacted that all slaves of persons who shall hereafter be engaged in rebellion against the government of the united states or who shall in any way give aid or comfort thereto escaping from such persons and taking refuge within the lines of the army and all slaves captured from such persons or deserted by them and coming under the control of the government of the united states and all slaves of such person found on or being within any place occupied by rebel forces and afterwards occupied by the forces of the united states shall be deemed captives of war and shall be forever free of their servitude and not again held as slaves thus everyone who six zero days after july one seven one eight six two supported the rebellion was to be punished by having all their slaves freed the goal was to weaken the rebellion which was led and controlled by slave owners this did not abolish the legal institution of slavery the xiii amendment did that but it shows lincoln had the support of and was even somewhat pushed by congress in liberating the slaves owned by rebels lincoln implemented the new law by his emancipation proclamation lincoln is well known for ending slavery in the united states and he personally opposed slavery as a profound moral evil not in accord with the principle of equality asserted in the declaration of independence yet lincoln s views of the role of the federal government on the subject of slavery are more complicated before the confederate states seceded lincoln had campaigned against the expansion of slavery into the territories where congress did have authority however he maintained that the federal government could not constitutionally bar slavery in states where it already existed during his presidency lincoln made it clear that the north was fighting the war to preserve the union not to abolish slavery freeing the slaves was a war measure to weaken the rebellion by destroying the economic base of its leadership class lincoln was criticized both at home and abroad for his refusal to take a stand for the complete abolition of slavery on august two two one eight six two a few weeks before signing the proclamation and after it had already been drafted lincoln responded by letter to an editorial by horace greeley of the new york tribune which had urged abolition i would save the union i would save it the shortest way under the constitution the sooner the national authority can be restored the nearer the union will be the union as it was if there be those who would not save the union unless they could at the same time save slavery i do not agree with them if there be those who would not save the union unless they could at the same time destroy slavery i do not agree with them my paramount object in this struggle is to save the union and is not either to save or to destroy slavery if i could save the union without freeing any slave i would do it and if i could save it by freeing all the slaves i would do it and if i could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone i would also do that what i do about slavery and the colored race i do because i believe it helps to save the union and what i forbear i forbear because i do not believe it would help to save the union i shall do less whenever i shall believe what i am doing hurts the cause and i shall do more whenever i shall believe doing more will help the cause i shall try to correct errors when shown to be errors and i shall adopt new views so fast as they shall appear to be true views i have here stated my purpose according to my view of official duty and i intend no modification of my oft expressed personal wish that all men everywhere could be free with the emancipation proclamation issued in two parts on september two two one eight six two and january one one eight six three lincoln made the abolition of slavery a goal of the war lincoln addresses the issue of his consistency or lack thereof between his earlier position and his later position on emancipation in an one eight six four letter to albert g hodges lincoln is often credited with freeing enslaved african americans with the emancipation proclamation however border states that still allowed slavery but were under union control were exempt from the emancipation because they were not covered under any war measures the proclamation on its first day january one one eight six three freed only a few escaped slaves but as union armies advanced south more and more slaves were liberated until hundreds of thousands were freed exactly how many is unknown lincoln signed the proclamation as a wartime measure insisting that only the outbreak of war gave constitutional power to the president to free slaves in states where it already existed he later said i never in my life felt more certain that i was doing right than i do in signing this paper the proclamation made abolishing slavery in the rebel states an official war goal and it became the impetus for the enactment of the one three th amendment to the united states constitution which abolished slavery lincoln was one of the main promoters of that amendment although some northern conservatives recoiled at the notion that the war was now being fought for the slaves instead of for preserving the union in the end the emancipation proclamation did much to help the northern cause politically lincoln s strong abolitionist stand finally convinced the united kingdom of great britain and ireland and other foreign countries that they could not support the confederate states of america this move remains one of the great seizures of private property by the federal government restoring the ownership of the blacks to themselves lincoln had for some time been working on plans to set up colonies in africa and south america for the nearly four million newly freed slaves he remarked upon colonization favorably in the emancipation proclamation but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed important domestic measures of lincoln s first term while lincoln is usually portrayed bearded he first grew a beard in one eight six one at the suggestion of one one year old grace bedell lincoln believed in the whig theory of the presidency which left congress to write the laws he was anti vescovian he signed them vetoing only bills that threatened his war powers thus he signed the homestead act in one eight six two making available millions of acres of government held land in the west for purchase at very low cost the morrill land grant colleges act also signed in one eight six two provided government grants for agricultural universities in each state lincoln also signed the pacific railway acts of one eight six two and one eight six four which granted federal support to the construction of the united states first transcontinental railroad which was completed in one eight six nine the most important legislation involved money matters including the first income tax and higher tariffs most important was the creation of the system of national banks by the national banking acts of one eight six three one eight six four and one eight six five which allowed the creation of a strong national financial system lincoln sent a senior general to put down the sioux uprising of august one eight six two in minnesota presented with three zero three death warrants for convicted santee dakota who had massacred innocent farmers lincoln affirmed three nine of these for execution one was later reprieved one eight six four election and second inauguration after union victories at gettysburg vicksburg and chattanooga in one eight six three many in the north believed that victory was soon to come after lincoln appointed u s grant general in chief on march one two one eight six four although no president since andrew jackson had been elected to a second term and none since van buren had been re nominated lincoln s re election was considered a certainty however when the spring campaigns east and west all turned into bloody stalemates northern morale dipped and lincoln seemed less likely to be re nominated treasury secretary salmon p chase strongly desired the republican nomination and was working hard to win it while john fremont was nominated by a breakoff group of radical republicans potentially taking away crucial votes in the november elections fearing he might lose the election lincoln wrote out and signed the following pledge but did not show it to his cabinet asking them each to sign the sealed envelope lincoln wrote this morning as for some days past it seems exceedingly probable that this administration will not be re elected then it will be my duty to so co operate with the president elect as to save the union between the election and the inauguration as he will have secured his election on such ground that he can not possibly save it afterwards the democrats hoping to make setbacks in the war a top campaign issue waited until late summer to nominate a candidate their platform was heavily influenced by the peace wing of the party calling the war a failure but their candidate former general george mcclellan was a war democrat determined to prosecute the war until the union was restored although willing to compromise on all other issues including slavery mcclellan s candidacy was soon undercut as on september one just two days after the convention atlanta was abandoned by the confederate army coming on the heels of david farragut s capture of mobile bay and followed by phil sheridan s crushing victory over jubal early s army at cedar creek it was now apparent that the tide had turned in favor of the union and that lincoln may be reelected despite the costs of the war still lincoln believed that he would win the electoral vote by only a slim margin failing to give him the mandate he d need if he was to push his lenient reconstruction plan to his surprise lincoln ended up winning all but two states capturing two one two of two three three electoral votes after lincoln s election on march four one eight six five he delivered his second inaugural address which was his favorite of all his speeches at this time a victory over the rebels was within sight slavery had effectively ended and lincoln was looking to the future fondly do we hope fervently do we pray that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away yet if god wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bond man s two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword as was said three thousand years ago so still it must be said the judgments of the lord are true and righteous altogether with malice toward none with charity for all with firmness in the right as god gives us to see the right let us strive on to finish the work we are in to bind up the nation s wounds to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations civil war and reconstruction conducting the war effort the war was a source of constant frustration for the president and it occupied nearly all of his time lincoln had a contentious relationship with general george b mcclellan who became general in chief of all the union armies in the wake of the embarrassing union defeat at the first battle of bull run and after the retirement of winfield scott in late one eight six one lincoln wished to take an active part in planning the war strategy despite his inexperience in military affairs lincoln s strategic priorities were two fold first to ensure that washington d c was well defended and second to conduct an aggressive war effort in hopes of ending the war quickly and appeasing the northern public and press who pushed for an offensive war mcclellan a youthful west point graduate and railroad executive called back to military service took a more cautious approach mcclellan took several months to plan and execute his peninsula campaign which involved capturing richmond by moving the army of the potomac by boat to the peninsula between the james and york rivers mcclellan s delay irritated lincoln as did mcclellan s insistence that no troops were needed to defend washington d c lincoln insisted on holding some of mcclellan s troops to defend the capital a decision mcclellan blamed for the ultimate failure of his peninsula campaign mcclellan a lifelong democrat who was temperamentally conservative was relieved as general in chief after releasing his harrison s landing letter where he offered unsolicited political advice to lincoln urging caution in the war effort mcclellan s letter incensed radical republicans who successfully pressured lincoln to appoint fellow republican john pope as head of the new army of virginia pope complied with lincoln s strategic desire for the union to move towards richmond from the north thus guarding washington d c however pope was soundly defeated at the second battle of bull run during the summer of one eight six two forcing the army of the potomac back into the defenses of washington for a second time pope was sent to minnesota to fight the sioux panicked by confederate general robert e lee s invasion of maryland lincoln restored mcclellan to command of all forces around washington in time for the battle of antietam in september one eight six two it was the union victory in that battle that allowed lincoln to release his emancipation proclamation lincoln relieved mcclellan of command shortly after the one eight six two midterm elections and appointed republican ambrose burnside to head the army of the potomac who promised to follow through on lincoln s strategic vision for an aggressive offensive against lee and richmond after burnside was stunningly defeated at fredericksburg joseph hooker was given command despite his idle talk about becoming a military strong man hooker was routed by lee at chancellorsville in may one eight six three and also relieved of command after the union victory at gettysburg meade s failure to pursue lee and months of inactivity for the army of the potomac lincoln decided to bring in a western general general ulysses s grant he had a solid string of victories in the western theater including vicksburg and chattanooga earlier reacting to criticism of grant lincoln was quoted as saying i cannot spare this man he fights grant waged his bloody overland campaign in one eight six four using a strategy of a war of attrition characterized by high union losses at battles such as the wilderness and cold harbor but by proportionately higher losses in the confederate army grant s aggressive campaign would eventually bottle up lee in the siege of petersburg and result in the union taking richmond and bringing the war to a close in the spring of one eight six five lincoln authorized grant to use a scorched earth approach to destroy the south s morale and economic ability to continue the war this allowed generals william tecumseh sherman and philip sheridan to destroy farms and towns in the shenandoah valley georgia and south carolina the damage in sherman s march to the sea through georgia totaled in excess of one zero zero million lincoln had a star crossed record as a military leader possessing a keen understanding of strategic points such as the mississippi river and the fortress city of vicksburg and the importance of defeating the enemy s army rather than simply capturing cities however he had little success in his efforts to motivate his generals to adopt his strategies eventually he found in grant a man who shared his vision of the war and was able to bring that vision to reality with his relentless pursuit of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters of war lincoln perhaps reflecting his lack of military experience developed a keen curiosity with military campaigning during the war he spent hours at the war department telegraph office reading dispatches from his generals through many a night he frequently visited battle sites and seemed fascinated by watching scenes of war during jubal a early s raid into washington d c in one eight six four lincoln had to be told to duck his head to avoid being shot while observing the scenes of battle homefront lincoln was more successful in giving the war meaning to northern civilians through his oratorical skills despite his meager education and backwoods upbringing lincoln possessed an extraordinary command of the english language as evidenced by the gettysburg address a speech dedicating a cemetery of union soldiers from the battle of gettysburg that he delivered on november one nine one eight six three while the featured speaker orator edward everett spoke for two hours lincoln s few choice words resonated across the nation and across history defying lincoln s own prediction that the world will little note nor long remember what we say here lincoln s second inaugural address is also greatly admired and often quoted in these speeches lincoln articulated better than any of his contemporaries the rationale behind the union effort during the civil war lincoln exercised powers no previous president had wielded he proclaimed a blockade suspended the writ of habeas corpus spent money without congressional authorization and imprisoned thousands of accused confederate sympathizers without trial there is a fragment of uncorraborated evidence that lincoln made contingency plans to arrest chief justice roger brooke taney though the allegation remains unresolved and controversial see the taney arrest warrant controversy the long war and the issue of emancipation appeared to be severely hampering his prospects and pessimists warned that defeat appeared likely lincoln ran under the union party banner composed of war democrats and republicans general grant was facing severe criticism for his conduct of the bloody overland campaign that summer and the seemingly endless siege of petersburg however the union capture of the key railroad center of atlanta by sherman s forces in september changed the situation dramatically and lincoln was reelected reconstruction the reconstruction of the union weighed heavy on the president s mind throughout the war effort he was determined to take a course that would not permanently alienate the former confederate states and throughout the war lincoln urged speedy elections under generous terms in areas behind union lines this irritated congressional republicans who urged a more stringent reconstruction policy one of lincoln s few vetoes during his term was of the wade davis bill an effort by congressional republicans to impose harsher reconstruction terms on the confederate areas republicans in congress retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from louisiana arkansas and tennessee during the war under lincoln s generous terms let em up easy he told his assembled military leaders gen ulysses s grant a future president gen william t sherman and adm david dixon porter in an one eight six five meeting on the steamer river queen when richmond the confederate capital was at long last captured lincoln went there to make a public gesture of sitting at jefferson davis s own desk symbolically saying to the nation that the president of the united states held authority over the entire land he was greeted at the city as a conquering hero by freed slaves whose sentiments were epitomized by one admirer s quote i know i am free for i have seen the face of father abraham and have felt him on april nine one eight six five confederate general robert e lee surrendered at appomattox court house in virginia this left only joseph johnston s forces in the east to deal with weeks later johnston would defy jefferson davis and surrender his forces to sherman of course lincoln would not survive to see the surrender of all confederate forces just five days after lee surrendered lincoln was assassinated he was the first president to be assassinated and the third to die in office assassination the assassination of abraham lincoln from left to right henry rathbone clara harris mary todd lincoln lincoln and booth lincoln had met frequently with lt gen ulysses s grant as the war drew to a close the two men planned matters of reconstruction and it was evident to all that they held each other in high regard during their last meeting on april one four one eight six five good friday lincoln invited grant to a social engagement that evening grant declined grant s wife julia dent grant is said to have strongly disliked mary todd lincoln the president s eldest son robert todd lincoln also turned down the invitation john wilkes booth a well known actor and southern sympathizer from maryland heard that the president and mrs lincoln along with the grants would be attending ford s theatre having failed in a plot to kidnap lincoln earlier booth informed his co conspirators of his intention to kill lincoln others were assigned to assassinate vice president andrew johnson and secretary of state william seward without his bodyguard ward hill lamon to whom he related his famous dream of his own assassination the lincolns left to attend the play at ford s theater the play our american cousin was a musical comedy by the british writer tom taylor as lincoln sat in his state box in the balcony booth crept up behind the president s box and waited for the funniest line of the play hoping the laughter would cover the gunshot noise on stage actor harry hawk said the last words lincoln would ever hear well i guess i know enough to turn you inside out old gal you sockdologizing old man trap when the laughter came booth jumped into the box the president was in and aimed a single shot round slug four four caliber deringer at his head firing at point blank range the bullet entered behind lincoln s left ear and lodged behind his right eyeball major henry rathbone who was present in the presidential box momentarily grappled with booth but was severely stabbed and slashed by the assassin it was believed that booth then shouted sic semper tyrannis latin thus always to tyrants the state motto of virginia some accounts say he added the south is avenged and jumped from the balcony to the stage below breaking his leg despite his injury booth managed to limp to his horse and make his escape as booth fled from the theater a young physician dr charles leale made his way through the audience to lincoln s box leale quickly assessed the wound as mortal the president was taken across the street from the theater to the petersen house where he lay in a coma for nine hours before he expired several physicians attended lincoln including u s army surgeon general joseph k barnes of the army medical museum using a probe barnes located some fragments of lincoln s skull and the ball lodged six inches inside his brain lincoln who never regained consciousness was officially pronounced dead at seven two two a m the next morning april one five one eight six five upon his death secretary of war edwin stanton lamented now he belongs to the ages after lincoln s body was returned to the white house his body was prepared for his lying in state in the east room the army

to illinois lincoln s body was carried by train in a grand funeral procession through several states on its way back to illinois the nation mourned a man whom many viewed as the savior of the united states he was buried in oak ridge cemetery in springfield where a one seven seven foot five four m tall granite tomb surmounted with several bronze statues of lincoln was constructed by one eight

five six who appeared two months before his death at age nine six on the cbs tv quiz show i ve got a secret he said that as a five year old he had thought at first that he himself had been shot because his nurse trying to fix a torn place in his blouse stuck him with a pin at the moment of the gun s discharge according to legend lincoln was referred to as two faced by his opponent in the one eight five eight senate election stephen douglas upon hearing about this lincoln jokingly replied if i had another face to wear do you really think i would be wearing this one according to legend lincoln also said as a young man on his appearance one day when looking in the mirror it s a fact abe you are the ugliest man in the world if ever i see a man uglier than you i m going to shoot him on the spot it would no doubt he thought be an act of mercy based on written descriptions of lincoln including the observations that he was much taller than most men of his day and had long limbs an abnormally shaped chest and loose or lax joints it has been conjectured since the one nine six zero s that lincoln may have suffered from marfan syndrome lincoln was known to have a case of depression during his time in new salem illinois his fiancee died and that triggered his depression his close friends watched over him to make sure he did not commit suicide he also suffered from nightmares

candidates welsh americans aristotle aristotel s three eight four bc march seven three two two bc was an ancient greek philosopher who studied with plato and taught alexander the great he wrote books on many subjects including physics poetry zoology logic rhetoric government and biology aristotle along with plato and socrates is generally considered one of the most influential of ancient greek philosophers they transformed presocratic greek philosophy into the foundations of western philosophy as we know it the writings of plato and aristotle founded two of the most important schools of ancient philosophy aristotle valued knowledge gained from the senses and in modern terms would be classed among the modern empiricists see materialism and empiricism he also achieved a grounding of dialectic in the topics by allowing interlocutors to begin from commonly held beliefs endoxa his goal being non contradiction rather than truth he set the stage for what would eventually develop into the empiricist version of scientific method centuries later although he wrote dialogues early in his career no more than fragments of these have survived the works of aristotle that still exist today are in treatise form and were for the most part unpublished texts these were probably lecture notes or texts used by his students and were almost certainly revised repeatedly over the course of years as a result these works tend to be eclectic dense and difficult to read among the most important ones are physics metaphysics or ontology nicomachean ethics politics de anima on the soul and poetics these works although connected in many fundamental ways are very different in both style and substance aristotle is known for being one of the few figures in history who studied almost every subject possible at the time in science aristotle studied anatomy astronomy economics embryology geography geology meteorology physics and zoology in philosophy aristotle wrote on aesthetics ethics government metaphysics politics psychology rhetoric and theology he also dealt with education foreign customs literature and poetry his combined works practically constitute an encyclopedia of greek knowledge biography early life and studies at the academy a bust of aristotle is a nearly ubiquitous ornament in places of high culture in the west aristotle was born at stageira a colony of andros on the macedonian peninsula of chalcidice in three eight four bc his father nicomachus was court physician to king amyntas iii of macedon it is believed that aristotle s ancestors held this position under various kings of the macedons as such aristotle s early education would probably have consisted of instruction in medicine and biology from his father about his mother phaestis little is known it is known that she died early in aristotle s life when nicomachus also died in aristotle s tenth year he was left an orphan and placed under the guardianship of his uncle proxenus of atarneus he taught aristotle greek rhetoric and poetry o connor et al two zero zero four aristotle was probably influenced by his father s medical knowledge when he went to athens at the age of one eight he was likely already trained in the investigation of natural phenomena from the age of one eight to three seven aristotle remained in athens as a pupil of plato and distinguished himself at the academy the relations between plato and aristotle have formed the subject of various legends many of which depict aristotle unfavourably no doubt there were divergences of opinion between plato who took his stand on sublime idealistic principles and aristotle who even at that time showed a preference for the investigation of the facts and laws of the physical world it is also probable that plato suggested that aristotle needed restraining rather than encouragement but not that there was an open breach of friendship in fact aristotle s conduct after the death of plato his continued association with xenocrates and other platonists and his allusions in his writings to plato s doctrines prove that while there were conflicts of opinion between plato and aristotle there was no lack of cordial appreciation or mutual forbearance besides this the legends that reflect aristotle unfavourably are traceable to the epicureans who were known as slanderers if such legends were circulated widely by patristic writers such as justin martyr and gregory nazianzen the reason lies in the exaggerated esteem aristotle was held in by the early christian heretics not in any well grounded historical tradition aristotle as philosopher and tutor after the death of plato three four seven bc aristotle was considered as the next head of the academy a position that was eventually awarded to plato s nephew aristotle then went with xenocrates to the court of hermias ruler of atarneus in asia minor and married his niece and adopted daughter pythia in three four four bc hermias was murdered in a rebellion and aristotle went with his family to mytilene it is also reported that he stopped on lesbos and briefly conducted biological research then one or two years later he was summoned to pella the macedonian capital by king philip ii of macedon to become the tutor of alexander the great who was then one three plutarch wrote that aristotle not only imparted to alexander a knowledge of ethics and politics but also of the most profound secrets of philosophy we have much proof that alexander profited by contact with the philosopher and that aristotle made prudent and beneficial use of his influence over the young prince although bertrand russell disputes this due to this influence alexander provided aristotle with ample means for the acquisition of books and the pursuit of his scientific investigation it is possible that aristotle also participated in the education of alexander s boyhood friends which may have included for example hephaestion and harpalus aristotle maintained a long correspondence with hephaestion eventually collected into a book unfortunately now lost according to sources such as plutarch and diogenes philip had aristotle s hometown of stageira burned during the three four zero s bc and aristotle successfully requested that alexander rebuild it during his tutorship of alexander aristotle was reportedly considered a second time for leadership of the academy his companion xenocrates was selected instead founder and master of the lyceum in about three three five bc alexander departed for his asiatic campaign and aristotle who had served as an informal adviser more or less since alexander ascended the macedonian throne returned to athens and opened his own school of philosophy he may as aulus gellius says have conducted a school of rhetoric during his former residence in athens but now following plato s example he gave regular instruction in philosophy in a gymnasium dedicated to apollo lyceios from which his school has come to be known as the lyceum it was also called the peripatetic school because aristotle preferred to discuss problems of philosophy with his pupils while walking up and down peripateo the shaded walks peripatoi around the gymnasium during the thirteen years three three five bc three two two bc which he spent as teacher of the lyceum aristotle composed most of his writings imitating plato he wrote dialogues in which his doctrines were expounded in somewhat popular language he also composed the several treatises which will be mentioned below on physics metaphysics and so forth in which the exposition is more didactic and the language more technical than in the dialogues these writings show to what good use he put the resources alexander had provided for him they show particularly how he succeeded in bringing together the works of his predecessors in greek philosophy and how he pursued either personally or through others his investigations in the realm of natural phenomena pliny claimed that alexander placed under aristotle s orders all the hunters fishermen and fowlers of the royal kingdom and all the overseers of the royal forests lakes ponds and cattle ranges and aristotle s works on zoology make this statement more believable aristotle was fully informed about the doctrines of his predecessors and strabo asserted that he was the first to accumulate a great library during the last years of aristotle s life the relations between him and alexander became very strained owing to the disgrace and punishment of callisthenes whom aristotle had recommended to alexander nevertheless aristotle continued to be regarded at athens as a friend of alexander and a representative of macedonia consequently when alexander s death became known in athens and the outbreak occurred which led to the lamian war aristotle shared in the general unpopularity of the macedonians the charge of impiety which had been brought against anaxagoras and socrates was now with even less reason brought against aristotle he left the city saying according to many ancient authorities that he would not give the athenians a chance to sin a third time against philosophy he took up residence at his country house at chalcis in euboea and there he died the following year three two two bc his death was due to a disease reportedly of the stomach from which he had long suffered the story that his death was due to hemlock poisoning as well as the legend that he threw himself into the sea because he could not explain the tides is without historical foundation very little is known about aristotle s personal appearance except from hostile sources the statues and busts of aristotle possibly from the first years of the peripatetic school represent him as sharp and keen of countenance and somewhat below the average height his character as revealed by his writings his will which is undoubtedly genuine fragments of his letters and the allusions of his unprejudiced contemporaries was that of a high minded kind hearted man devoted to his family and his friends kind to his slaves fair to his enemies and rivals grateful towards his benefactors when platonism ceased to dominate the world of christian speculation and the works of aristotle began to be studied without fear and prejudice the personality of aristotle appeared to the christian writers of the one three th century as it had to the unprejudiced pagan writers of his own day as calm majestic untroubled by passion and undimmed by any great moral defects the master of those who know aristotle s legacy also had a profound influence on islamic thought and philosophy during the middle ages the likes of avicenna farabi and yaqub ibn ishaq al kindi one were a few of the major proponents of the aristotelian school of thought during the golden age of islam methodology aristotle defines philosophy in terms of essence saying that philosophy is the science of the universal essence of that which is actual plato had defined it as the science of the idea meaning by idea what we should call the unconditional basis of phenomena both pupil and master regard philosophy as concerned with the universal aristotle however finds the universal in particular things and called it the essence of things while plato finds that the universal exists apart from particular things and is related to them as their prototype or exemplar for aristotle therefore philosophic method implies the ascent from the study of particular phenomena to the knowledge of essences while for plato philosophic method means the descent from a knowledge of universal ideas to a contemplation of particular imitations of those ideas in a certain sense aristotle s method is both inductive and deductive while plato s is essentially deductive in aristotle s terminology the term natural philosophy corresponds to the phenomena of the natural world which include motion light and the laws of physics many centuries later these subjects would become the basis of modern science as studied through the scientific method in modern times the term philosophy has come to be more narrowly understood as metaphysics distinct from empirical study of the natural world via the physical sciences in contrast in aristotle s time and use philosophy was taken to encompass all facets of intellectual inquiry in the larger sense of the word he makes philosophy coextensive with reasoning which he also called science note however that his use of the term science carries a different meaning than that which is covered by the scientific method all science dianoia is either practical poetical or theoretical by practical science he understands ethics and politics by poetical he means the study of poetry and the other fine arts while by theoretical philosophy he means physics mathematics and metaphysics the last philosophy in the stricter sense he defines as the knowledge of immaterial being and calls it first philosophy the theologic science or of being in the highest degree of abstraction if logic or as aristotle calls it analytic be regarded as a study preliminary to philosophy we have as divisions of aristotelian philosophy one logic two theoretical philosophy including metaphysics physics mathematics three practical philosophy and four poetical philosophy aristotle s epistemology logic history aristotle says that on the subject of reasoning he had nothing else on an earlier date to speak about boche ski one nine five one however plato reports that syntax was thought of before him by prodikos of keos who was concerned by the right use of words logic seems to have emerged from dialectics the earlier philosophers used concepts like reductio ad absurdum as a rule when discussing but never understood its logical implications even plato had difficulties with logic although he had the idea of constructing a system for deduction he was never able to construct one instead he relied on his dialectic which was a confusion between different sciences and methods boche ski one nine five one plato thought that deduction would simply follow from premises so he focused on having good premises so that the conclusion would follow later on plato realised that a method for obtaining the conclusion would be beneficial plato never obtained such a method but his best attempt was published in his book sophist where he introduced his division method rose one nine six eight analytics and the organon what we call today aristotelian logic aristotle himself would have labelled analytics the term logic he reserved to mean dialectics most of aristotle s work is probably not in its original form since it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers the logical works of aristotle were compiled into six books at about the time of christ categories on interpretation prior analytics posterior analytics topics on sophistical refutations the order of the books or the teachings from which they are composed is not certain but this list was derived from analysis of aristotle s writings there is one volume of aristotle s concerning logic not found in the organon namely the fourth book of metaphysics boche ski one nine five one modal logic aristotle is also the creator of syllogisms with modalities modal logic the word modal refers to the word modes explaining the fact that modal logic deals with the modes of truth aristotle introduced the qualification of necessary and possible premises he constructed a logic which helped in the evaluation of truth but which was very difficult to interpret rose one nine six eight science aristotle by francesco hayez aristotelian discussions about science had only been qualitative not quantitative by the modern definition of the term aristotelian philosophy was not science as this worldview did not attempt to probe how the world actually worked through experiment for example in his book the history of animals he claimed that human males have more teeth than females had he only made some observations he would have discovered that this claim is false rather based on what one s senses told one aristotelian philosophy then depended upon the assumption that man s mind could elucidate all the laws of the universe based on simple observation without experimentation through reason alone one of the reasons for this was that aristotle held that physics was about changing objects with a reality of their own whereas mathematics was about unchanging objects without a reality of their own in this philosophy he could not imagine that there was a relationship between them in contrast today s science assumes that thinking alone often leads people astray and therefore one must compare one s ideas to the actual world through experimentation only then can one see if one s ideas are based in reality this position is known as empiricism or the scientific method although aristotle initiated an important step in the history of scientific method by founding logic as a formal science he also left behind a trail of bankrupt cosmology that we may discern in selections of the metaphysics his cosmology would gain much acceptance up until the one five zero zero s where copernicus and galileo began to figure out that europe is not the center of the universe from the three rd century to the one five zero zero s the dominant view held that the earth was the center of the universe at this late date it is uncontroversial that the earth is not even the center of our own solar system in spite of aristotle s bogus account of the planets and sun he is a vital character in the history of metaphysics both in terms of the etymology of the word as well as a figure within metaphysics as a discipline dubbed the stuff next to the physics by andronicus of rhodes metaphysics became connected to the idea of beyond the physical by simplicius a commentator on aristotle andronicus had published aristotle s works sometime around four three two zero bc so initially the etymology of metaphysics was simply that which is next to the physics aristotle s metaphysics causality aristole is the first who saw that all causes of things are beginnings that we have scientific knowledge when we know the cause that to know a thing s existence is to know the reason for its existence setting the guidelines for all the subsequent causal theories by specifying the number nature principles elements varieties order and modes of causation aristotle s account of the causes of things is the most comprehensive theory up to now according to aristotle s theory all the causes fall into several senses the total number of which amounts to the ways the question why may be answered namely by reference to the matter or the substratum the essence the pattern the form or the structure to the primary moving change or the agent and its action and to the goal the plan the end or the good consequently the major kinds of causes come under the following divisions the material cause is that from which a thing comes into existence as from its parts constituents substratum or materials this reduces the explanation of causes to the parts factors elements constituents ingredients forming the whole system structure compound complex composite or combination the part whole causation the formal cause tells us what a thing is that any thing is determined by the definition form pattern essence whole synthesis or archetype it embraces the account of causes in terms of fundamental principles or general laws as the whole macrostructure is the cause of its parts the whole part causation the efficient cause is that from which the change or the ending of the change first starts it identifies what makes of what is made and what causes change of what is changed and so suggests all sorts of agents nonliving or living acting as the sources of change or movement or rest representing the current understanding of causality as the relation of cause and effect this covers the modern definitions of cause as either the agent or agency or particular events or states of affairs the final cause is that for the sake of which a thing exists or is done including both purposeful and instrumental actions and activities the final cause or telos is the purpose or end that something is supposed to serve or it is that from which and that to which the change is this also covers modern ideas of mental causation involving such psychological causes as volition need motivation or motives rational irrational ethical all that gives purpose to behavior additionally things can be causes of one another causing each other reciprocally as hard work causes fitness and vice versa although not in the same way or function the one is as the beginning of change the other as the goal thus aristotle first suggested a reciprocal or circular causality as a relation of mutual dependence or action or influence of cause and effect also aristotle indicated that the same thing can be the cause of contrary effects its presence and absent may result in different outcomes besides aristotle marked two modes of causation proper prior causation and accidental chance causation all causes proper and incidental can be spoken as potential or as actual particular or generic the same language refers to the effects of causes so that generic effects assigned to generic causes particular effects to particular causes operating causes to actual effects essentiallly causality does not suggest a temporal relation between the cause and the effect all further investigations of causality will be consisting in imposing the favorite hierarchies on the order causes like as final efficient material formal aquinas or in restricting all causality to the material and efficient causes or to the efficient causality deterministic or chance or just to regular sequences and correlations of natural phenomena the natural sciences describing how things happen instead of explaining the whys and wherefores chance and spontaneity spontaneity and chance are causes of effects chance as an incidental cause lies in the realm of accidental things it is from what is spontaneous but note that what is spontaneous does not come from chance for a better understanding of aristotle s conception of chance it might be better to think of coincidence something takes place by chance if a person sets out with the intent of having one thing take place but with the result of another thing not intended taking place for example a person seeks donations that person may find another person willing to donate a substantial sum however if the person seeking the donations met the person donating not for the purpose of collecting donations but for some other purpose aristotle would call the collecting of the donation by that particular donator a result of chance it must be unusual that something happens by chance in other words if something happens all or most of the time we cannot say that it is by chance however chance can only apply to human beings it is in the sphere of moral actions according to aristotle chance must involve choice and thus deliberation and only humans are capable of deliberation and choice what is not capable of action cannot do anything by chance physics two six the five elements fire which is hot and dry earth which is cold and dry air which is hot and wet water which is cold and wet aether which is the divine substance that makes up the heavens these four elements interchange i e fire air water earth etc while aether is on its own the sun keeps this cycle going god keeps the sun going and thus the sun is eternal aristotle s ethics although aristotle wrote several works on ethics the major one was the nicomachean ethics which is considered one of aristotle s greatest works it discusses virtues the ten books which comprise it are based on notes from his lectures at the lyceum and were either edited by or dedicated to aristotle s son nicomachus aristotle believed that ethical knowledge is not certain knowledge like metaphysics and epistemology but general knowledge also as it is a practical discipline rather than a theoretical one he thought that in order to become good one could not simply study what virtue is one must actually do virtuous deeds in order to do this aristotle had first to establish what was virtuous he began by determining that everything was done with some goal in mind and that goal is good the ultimate goal he called the highest good aristotle contested that happiness could not be found only in pleasure or only in fame and honor he finally finds happiness by ascertaining the specific function of man but what is this function that will bring happiness to determine this aristotle analyzed the soul and found it to have three parts the nutritive soul plants animals and humans the perceptive soul animals and humans and the rational soul humans only thus a human s function is to do what makes it human to be good at what sets it apart from everything else the ability to reason or nous a person that does this is the happiest because they are fulfilling their purpose or nature as found in the rational soul depending on how well they did this aristotle said people belonged to one of four categories the virtuous the continent the incontinent and the vicious aristotle believes that every ethical virtue is an intermediate condition between excess and deficiency this does not mean aristotle believed in moral relativism however he set certain emotions e g hate envy jealousy spite etc and certain actions e g adultery theft murder etc as always wrong regardless of the situation or the circumstances nicomachean ethics in nicomachean ethics aristotle focuses on the importance of continually behaving virtuously and developing virtue rather than committing specific good actions this can be contrasted with kantian ethics in which the primary focus is on individual action nicomachean ethics emphasizes the importance of context to ethical behaviour what might be right in one situation might be wrong in another aristotle believed that happiness is the end of life and that as long as a person is striving for goodness good deeds will result from that struggle making the person virtuous and therefore happy aristotle s critics plato left and aristotle right a detail of the school of athens a fresco by raphael aristotle gestures to the earth representing his belief in knowledge through empirical observation and experience whilst plato points up to the heavens showing his belief in the ultimate truth aristotle has been criticised on several grounds his analysis of procreation is frequently criticised on the grounds that it presupposes an active ensouling masculine element bringing life to an inert passive lumpen female element it is on these grounds that some feminist critics refer to aristotle as a misogynist at times the objections that aristotle raises against the arguments of his own teacher plato appear to rely on faulty interpretations of those arguments although aristotle advised against plato that knowledge of the world could only be obtained through experience he frequently failed to take his own advice aristotle conducted projects of careful empirical investigation but often drifted into abstract logical reasoning with the result that his work was littered with conclusions that were not supported by empirical evidence for example his assertion that objects of different mass fall at different speeds under gravity which was later refuted by john philoponus credit is often given to galileo even though philopinus lived centuries earlier in the middle ages roughly from the one two th century to the one five th century the philosophy of aristotle became firmly established dogma although aristotle himself was far from dogmatic in his approach to philosophical inquiry two aspects of his philosophy might have assisted its transformation into dogma his works were wide ranging and systematic so that they could give the impression that no significant matter had been left unsettled he was also much less inclined to employ the skeptical methods of his predecessors socrates and plato some academics have suggested that aristotle was unaware of much of the current science of his own time aristotle was called not a great philosopher but the philosopher by scholastic thinkers these thinkers blended aristotelian philosophy with christianity bringing the thought of ancient greece into the middle ages it required a repudiation of some aristotelian principles for the sciences and the arts to free themselves for the discovery of modern scientific laws and empirical methods the loss of his works though we know that aristotle wrote many elegant treatises cicero described his literary style as a river of gold the originals have been lost in time all that we have now are the literary notes for his pupils which are often difficult to read the nicomachean ethics is a good example it is now believed that we have about one fifth of his original works aristotle underestimated the importance of his written work for humanity he thus never published his books except from his dialogues the story of the original manuscripts of his treatises is described by strabo in his geography and plutarch in his parallel lives sulla the manuscripts were left from aristotle to theophrastus from theophrastus to neleus of scepsis from neleus to his heirs their descendants sold them to apellicon of teos when sulla occupied athens in eight six bc he carried off the library of appellicon to rome where they were first published in six zero bc from the grammarian tyrranion of amisus and then by philosopher andronicus of rhodes bibliography note bekker numbers are often used to uniquely identify passages of aristotle they are identified below where available major works the extant works of aristotle are broken down according to the five categories in the corpus aristotelicum not all of these works are considered genuine but differ with respect to their connection to aristotle his associates and his views some such as the athenaion politeia or the fragments of other politeia are regarded by most scholars as products of aristotle s school and compiled under his direction or supervision other works such on colours may have been products of aristotle s successors at the lyceum e g theophrastus and straton still others acquired aristotle s name through similarities in doctrine or content such as

used almost as commonly as academy award even by the academy itself in fact the academy s domain name is oscars org and the official website for the academy awards is at oscar com awards night the major awards are given out at a ceremony most commonly in march following the relevant calendar year this is an elaborate extravaganza with the invited guests walking up the red carpet in the

all members may submit nominees for best picture the winners are then determined by a second round of voting in which all members are now allowed to vote in all categories membership academy membership may be obtained by one of two ways a competitive nomination however the nominee must be invited to join or a member may submit a name seconded by at least two other members then voted upon by the board of governors the academy does not publicly disclose its membership although past press releases have announced the names of those who have been invited to join if a person not yet a

is a weighted average of the time kept by about three zero zero atomic clocks including a large number of caesium atomic clocks in over five zero national laboratories worldwide it has been available since one nine five five and became the international standard on which utc is based on january one one nine seven two as decided by the one four th general conference on weights and measures cgpm the international bureau of weights and measures is in charge of the realization of tai the highest precision realization of tai times can only be determined retrospectively as the timescale is defined by periodic comparisons among its participating atomic clocks however these corrections are usually only needed for applications that require nanosecond scale accuracy most time service users use realtime estimates of tai provided by atomic clocks that have been previously referenced to the composite timescale gps is a commonly used realtime source of time traceable back to tai coordinated universal time utc is the basis for legal time throughout much of the world and always differs from tai by an integral number of seconds from one january two zero zero six utc was behind tai by three three seconds the difference is due to an initial ten second offset on one january one nine seven two when utc was established and leap seconds which have been periodically inserted into utc since the first on three zero june one nine seven two due to slight irregularities in earth s rate of rotation while tai is a continuous and stable timescale utc has intentional discontinuities to keep it from drifting more than zero nine second from ut one a timescale defined by the earth s rotation roughly speaking solar noon the time at which the sun is directly overhead would drift away from one two zero zero zero zero without leap second corrections ut one is computed by the international earth rotation and reference systems service iers tai was defined such that tai ut two on january one one nine five eight because utc is a discontinuous timescale it is not possible to compute the exact time interval elapsed between two utc timestamps without consulting a table that describes how many leap seconds occurred during that interval therefore many scientific applications that require precise measurement of long multi year intervals use tai instead tai is also commonly used by systems

religious traditions judge altruism to be virtuous in english the idea was often described as golden rule of ethics in buddhism it is considered a fundamental property of human nature altruism can refer to being helpful to other people with little or no interest in being rewarded for one s efforts the colloquial definition this is distinct from merely helping others actions that benefit others with a net detrimental or neutral effect on the actor regardless of the actor s own psychology motivation or the cause of his or her actions this type of altruistic behavior is referred to in ecology as commensalism an ethical doctrine that holds that individuals have a moral obligation to help others if necessary to the exclusion of one s own interest or benefit one who holds such a doctrine is known as an altruist the concepts have a long history in philosophical and ethical thought and have more recently become a topic for psychologists sociologists evolutionary biologists and ethologists while ideas about altruism from one field can have an impact on the other fields the different methods and focuses of these fields lead to different perspectives on altruism altruism can be distinguished from a feeling of loyalty and duty altruism focuses on a moral obligation towards all humanity while duty focuses on a moral obligation towards a specific individual e g a king a specific organization e g a government or an abstract concept e g god country etc some individuals may feel both altruism and duty while others may not as opposed to altruism duty is much easier to enforce by an authority altruism in ethics main article altruism ethical doctrine the word altruism french altruisme from autrui other people derived from latin alter other was coined by auguste comte the french founder of positivism in order to describe the ethical doctrine he supported he believed that individuals had a moral obligation to serve the interest of others or the greater good of humanity comte says in his catechisme positiviste that the social point of view cannot tolerate the notion of rights for such notion rests on individualism we are born under a load of obligations of every kind to our predecessors to our successors to our contemporaries after our birth these obligations increase or accumulate for it is some time before we can return any service this to live for others the definitive formula of human morality gives a direct sanction exclusively to our instincts of benevolence the common source of happiness and duty man must serve humanity whose we are entirely as the name of the ethical doctrine is altruism doing what the ethical doctrine prescribes has also come to be referred to by the term altruism serving others through placing their interests above one s own however the idea that one has a moral obligation to serve others is much older than auguste comte for example many of the world s oldest and most widespread religions particularly buddhism and christianity advocate it in the new testament of the christian bible it is explained as follows jesus made answer and said a certain man was going down from jerusalem to jericho and he fell among robbers who both stripped him and beat him and departed leaving him half dead and by chance a certain priest was going down that way and when he saw him he passed by on the other side and in like manner a levite also when he came to the place and saw him passed by on the other side but a certain samaritan as he journeyed came where he was and when he saw him he was moved with compassion and came to him and bound up his wounds pouring on them oil and wine and he set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn and took care of him and on the morrow he took out two shillings and gave them to the host and said take care of him and whatsoever thou spendest more i when i come back again will repay thee which of these three thinkest thou proved neighbor unto him that fell among the robbers and he said he that showed mercy on him and jesus said unto him go and do thou likewise luke one zero three zero three seven philosophers who support egoism have argued that altruism is demeaning to the individual and that no moral obligation to help others actually exists nietzsche asserts that altruism is predicated on the assumption that others are more important than one s self and that such a position is degrading and demeaning he also claims that it was very uncommon for people in europe to consider the sacrifice of one s own interests for others as virtuous until after the advent of christianity ayn rand argued that altruism is the willful sacrifice of one s values and represents the reversal of morality because only a rationally selfish ethics allows one to pursue the values required for human life advocates of altruism as an ethical doctrine maintain that one ought to act or refrain from acting so that benefit or good is bestowed on other people if necessary to the exclusion of one s own interests note that refraining from murdering someone for example is not altruism since he is not receiving a benefit or being helped as he already has his life this would amount to the same thing as ignoring someone altruism in ethology and evolutionary biology in the science of ethology the study of behavior altruism refers to behavior by an individual that increases the fitness of another individual while decreasing the fitness of the actor this would appear to be counter intuitive if one presumes that natural selection acts on the individual natural selection however acts on the gene pool of the subjects not on each subject individually recent developments in game theory have provided some explanations for apparent altruism as have traditional evolutionary analyses among the proposed mechanisms are behavioral manipulation e g by certain parasites that can alter the behavior of the host see bounded rationality e g herbert simon conscience indirect reciprocity e g reputation kin selection including eusociality see also selfish gene memes by influencing behavior to favour their own spread e g religion reciprocal altruism mutual aid sexual selection strong reciprocity the study of altruism was the initial impetus behind george r price s development of the price equation which is a mathematical equation used to study genetic evolution an interesting example of altruism is found in the cellular slime moulds such as dictyostelium mucoroides these protists live as individual amoebae until starved at which point they aggregate and form a multicellular fruiting body in which some cells sacrifice themselves to promote the survival of other cells in the fruiting body social behavior and altruism share many similaraties to the interactions between the many parts cells genes of an organism but are distinguished by the ability of each individual to reproduce indefinitely without an absolute requirement for its neighbors altruism in psychology and sociology if one performs an act beneficial to others with a view to gaining some personal benefit then it is not an altruistically motivated act there are several different perspectives on how benefit or interest should be defined a material gain e g money a physical reward etc is clearly a form of benefit while others identify and include both material and immaterial gains affection respect happiness satisfaction etc as being philosophically identical benefits according to psychological egoism while people can exhibit altruistic behavior they cannot have altruistic motivations psychological egoists would say that while they might very well spend their lives benefitting others with no material benefit or a material net loss to themselves their most basic motive for doing so is always to further their own interests for example it would be alleged that the foundational motive behind a person acting this way is to advance their own psychological well being good feeling critics of this theory often reject it on the grounds that it is non falsifiable in other words it is designed in such a way as to be impossible to prove or disprove because immaterial gains such as a good feeling cannot be measured or proven to exist in all people performing altruistic acts psychological egoism has also been accused of using circular logic if a person willingly performs an act that means he derives personal enjoyment from it therefore people only perform acts that give them personal enjoyment this statement is circular because its conclusion is identical to its hypothesis it assumes that people only perform acts that give them personal enjoyment and concludes that people only perform acts that give them personal enjoyment in contrast to psychological egoism the empathy altruism hypothesis states that when an individual experiences empathy towards someone in need the individual will then be altruistically motivated to help that person that is the individual will be primarily concerned about that person s welfare not his or her own in common parlance altruism usually means helping another person without expecting material reward from that or other persons although it may well entail the internal benefit of a good feeling sense of satisfaction self esteem fulfillment of duty whether imposed by a religion or ideology or simply one s conscience or the like in this way one need not speculate on the motives of the altruist in question humans are not exclusively altruistic towards family members previous co operators or potential future allies but can be altruistic towards people they don t know and will never meet for example humans donate to international charities and volunteer their time to help society s less fortunate it strains plausibility to claim that these altruistic deeds are done in the hope of a return favor the game theory analysis of this just in case strategy where the principle would be always help everyone in case you need to pull in a favor in return is a decidedly non optimal strategy where the net expenditure of effort tit is far greater than the net profit when it occasionally pays off tat according to some it is difficult to believe that these behaviors are solely explained as indirect selfish rationality be it conscious or sub conscious mathematical formulations of kin selection along the lines of the prisoner s dilemma are helpful as far as they go but what a game theoretic explanation glosses over is the fact that altruistic behavior can be attributed to that apparently mysterious phenomenon the conscience one recent suggestion proposed by the philosopher daniel dennett was initially developed when considering the problem of so called free riders in the tragedy of the commons a larger scale version of the prisoner s dilemma in game theory terms a free rider is an agent who draws benefits from a co operative society without contributing in a one to one situation free riding can easily be discouraged by a tit for tat strategy but in a larger scale society where contributions and benefits are pooled and shared they can be incredibly difficult to shake off imagine an elementary society of co operative organisms co operative agents interact with each other each contributing resources and each drawing on the common good now imagine a rogue free rider an agent who draws a favor you scratch my back and later refuses to return it the problem is that free riding is always going to be beneficial to individuals at cost to society how can well behaved co operative agents avoid being cheated over many generations one obvious solution is for co operators to evolve the ability to spot potential free riders in advance and refuse to enter into reciprocal arrangements with them then the canonical free rider response is to evolve a more convincing disguise fooling co operators into co operating after all this can lead to an evolutionary arms races with ever more sophisticated disguises and ever more sophisticated detectors in this evolutionary arms race how best might one convince comrades that one really is a genuine co operator not a free rider in disguise one answer is by actually making oneself a genuine co operator by erecting psychological barriers to breaking promises and by advertising this fact to everyone else in other words a good solution is for organisms to evolve things that everyone knows will force them to be co operators and to make it obvious that they ve evolved these things so evolution will produce organisms who are sincerely moral and who wear their hearts on their sleeves in short evolution will give rise to the phenomenon of conscience this theory combined with ideas of kin selection and the one to one sharing of benefits may explain how a blind and fundamentally selfish process can produce a genuinely non cynical form of altruism that gives rise to the human conscience critics of such technical game theory analysis point out that it appears to forget that human beings are rational and emotional to presume an analysis of human behaviour without including human rationale or emotion is necessarily unrealistically narrow and treats human beings as if they are mere machines sometimes called homo economicus another objection is that often people donate anonymously so that it is impossible to determine if they really did the altruistic act beginning with an understanding that rational human beings benefit from living in a benign universe logically it follows that particular human beings may gain substantial emotional satisfaction from acts which they perceive to make the world a better place comparison of altruism and tit for tat studying the simple strategy tit for tat in the iterated prisoner s dilemma problem game theorists argue that tit for tat is much more successful in establishing stable cooperation among individuals than altruism defined as unconditional cooperation can ever be tit for tat starts with cooperation in the first step as altruism does and then just imitates the behaviour of the partner step by step if the partner cooperates then he rewards him with cooperation if he doesn t then he punishes him by not cooperating in the next step confronted with many strategies that try to exploit or abuse cooperation of others this simple strategy surprisingly proved to be the most successful see the evolution of cooperation it was even more successful than these abusing strategies while unconditional cooperativity altruism was one of the most unsuccessful strategies confronted with altruistic behaviour tit for tat is indistinguishable from pure altruism robert axelrod and richard dawkins also showed that altruism may be harmful to society by nourishing exploiters and abusers and making them more and more powerful until they can force everyone to cooperate unconditionally which is not the case for tit for tat see also comparison of entrepreneur and entredonneur in the context of biology the tit for tat strategy is also called reciprocal altruism altruism in politics there is currently a pov dispute as to the wording of the section shown below if one is an adherent to the ethical doctrine called altruism that people have an ethical obligation to help or further the welfare of others then one will support the kind of politics that one believes to be most effective in furthering the welfare of others regardless of the effect this may have on oneself since there is no general consensus on what kind of politics results in the greatest benefit for others different altruists may have very different political views with regard to their political convictions altruists may be divided in two broad groups those who believe altruism is a matter of personal choice and therefore selfishness can and should be tolerated and those who believe that altruism is a moral ideal which should be embraced if possible by all human beings a prominent example of the former branch of altruist political thought is lysander spooner who in natural law writes man no doubt owes many other moral duties to his fellow men such as to feed the hungry clothe the naked shelter the homeless care for the sick protect the defenceless assist the weak and enlighten the ignorant but these are simply moral duties of which each man must be his own judge in each particular case as to whether and how and how far he can or will perform them the latter branch of altruist political thought on the other hand argues that egoism should be actively discouraged and that altruists have a duty not only to help other people but to teach those people to help each other as well thus in politics these altruists almost always take a left wing stance ranging from moderate social democracy to socialism or even communism moderate altruists of this branch may argue for the creation of taxation funded government programs aimed at benefiting the needy for example transfer payments such as social welfare or public healthcare and public education less obvious things such as a law that motorists pull over to let emergency vehicles pass may also be justified by appealing to the altruism ethic finally radical altruists of this branch may take things further and advocate some form of collectivism or communalism on a somewhat related note altruism is often held even by non altruists to be the kind of ethic that should guide the actions of politicians and other people in positions of power such people are usually expected to set their own interests aside and serve the populace when they do not they may be criticized as defaulting on what is believed to be an ethical obligation to place the interests of others above their own politicians often speak of a moral obligation of individuals to help others for example george bush speaking to the united nations said we have a moral obligation to help others and a moral duty to make sure our actions are effective if one is an adherent to the ethical doctrine called altruism that people have an ethical obligation to help or further the welfare of others it can become a moral justification for forcing or advocating forcing individuals to help others in the realm of politics the altruist may employ an agent in the form of government to enforce this supposed moral obligation this is not to say that an ethical altruist will necessarily force this on anyone an altruist may allow others the freedom to behave in a manner they believe to be immoral or selfish in other words their ethical doctrine would not manifest itself politically with regard those who believe benevolence is a moral obligation altruists may be divided in two broad groups those who believe helping others is a moral obligation but should not be enforced on individuals and those who believe that since helping others is a moral obligation forcing individuals to help others if they are not willing on their own is justified a prominent example of the former branch of altruist political thought is lysander spooner who in natural law writes man no doubt owes many other moral duties to his fellow men such as to feed the hungry clothe the naked shelter the homeless care for the sick protect the defenceless assist the weak and enlighten the ignorant but these are simply moral duties of which each man must be his own judge in each particular case as to whether and how and how far he can or will perform them the latter branch of altruist political thought on the other hand argues that egoism should be actively discouraged and that individuals should be forced to help other people thus in politics these altruists almost always take a left wing stance ranging from moderate social democracy to socialism or even communism moderate altruists of this branch may argue for the creation of taxation funded government programs aimed at benefiting the needy for example transfer payments such as social welfare or public healthcare and public education finally radical altruists of this branch may take things to an extreme and advocate some form of state enforced collectivism communalism or communism this is in line with august comte s philosophy who coined the term altruism which argues against individual rights finally many believe that helping others or serving society is not a moral obligation at all but that altrusm is an arbitrary pronouncement not philosophically derivable these oppose all government enforced charity individualist anarchist pierre joseph proudhon in one eight four seven warns of enforcing charity that is why charity the prime virtue of the christian the legitimate hope of the socialist the object of all the efforts of the economist is a social vice the moment it is made a principle of constitution and a law that is why certain economists have been able to say that legal charity had caused more evil in society than proprietary usurpation the philosophy of poverty comte asserts that individual rights are not compatible with the supposed obligation to serve others some argue that the ethical doctrine if taken to its logical conclusion leads to tyranny altruism and religion all the major world religions promote altruism as a very important moral value christianity and buddhism place particular emphasis on altruistic morality as noted above but judaism islam and hinduism also promote altruistic behavior the good samaritan is a famous new testament parable appearing only in the gospel of luke one zero

two born alissa zinovievna rosenbaum was best known for her philosophy of objectivism and her novels we the living anthem the fountainhead and atlas shrugged her philosophy and her fiction both emphasize above all the concepts of individualism rational egoism rational self interest and capitalism which she believed should be implemented fully via laissez faire capitalism her politics has been described as minarchism and libertarianism though she never used the first term and detested the second her novels were based upon the projection of the randian hero a man whose ability and independence causes conflict with the masses but who perseveres nevertheless to achieve his values rand viewed this hero as the ideal and the express goal of her fiction was to showcase such heroes she believed that man must choose his values and actions by reason that the individual has a right to exist for his own sake neither sacrificing self to others nor others to self and that no one has the right to seek values from others by physical force or impose ideas on others by physical force biography early life rand was born in saint petersburg russia and was the eldest of three daughters of a jewish family her parents were agnostic and largely non observant from an early age she displayed a strong interest in literature and films she started writing screenplays and novels from the age of seven her mother taught her french and subscribed to a magazine featuring stories for boys where rand found her first childhood hero cyrus paltons an indian army officer in a rudyard kipling style story called the mysterious valley throughout her youth she read the novels of sir walter scott alexandre dumas and other romantic writers and expressed a passionate enthusiasm toward the romantic movement as a whole she discovered victor hugo at the age of thirteen and fell deeply in love with his novels later she cited him as her favorite novelist and the greatest novelist of world literature she studied philosophy and history at the university of petrograd her major literary discoveries in university were the works of edmond rostand friedrich schiller and fyodor dostoevsky she admired rostand for his richly romantic imagination and schiller for his grand heroic scale she admired dostoevsky for his sense of drama and his intense moral judgments but was deeply against his philosophy and his sense of life she continued to write short stories and screenplays and wrote sporadically in her diary which contained intensely anti soviet ideas she also encountered the philosophical ideas of nietzsche and loved his exaltation of the heroic and independent individual who embraced egoism and rejected altruism in thus spoke zarathustra though an early fan of nietzsche she eventually became critical seeing his philosophy as emphasizing emotion over reason nevertheless as allan gotthelf points out in book on ayn rand the influence was real she did still retain an admiration for some of his ideas and quoted nietzsche in the introduction to the two five th aniversary edition of the fountainhead the noble soul has reverence for itself her greatest influence by far is aristotle especially organon logic although leonard peikoff promoter of her ideas says she is the greatest philosopher who ever lived she herself considered aristotle the greatest philosopher ever and stated that he was the only philosopher who had influenced her this is probably because as she has stated she did not include her own work when analyzing the culture she then entered the state institute for cinema arts in one nine two four to study screenwriting in late one nine two five however she was granted a visa to visit american relatives she arrived in the united states in february one nine two six at the age of twenty one after a brief stay with her relatives in chicago she resolved never to return to the soviet union and set out for hollywood to become a screenwriter she then changed her name to ayn rand there is a story told that she named herself after the remington rand typewriter but she began using the name ayn rand before the typewriter was first sold she stated that her first name ayn was an adaptation of the name of a finnish writer this may have been the finnish estonian author aino kallas but variations of this name are common in finnish speaking regions major works initially rand struggled in hollywood and took odd jobs to pay her basic living expenses while working as an extra on cecil b demille s king of kings she intentionally bumped into an aspiring young actor frank o connor who caught her eye the two married in one nine two nine in one nine three one rand became a naturalized citizen of the united states her first literary success came with the sale of her screenplay red pawn in one nine three two to universal studios rand then wrote the play the night of january one six th in one nine three four which was highly successful and published two novels we the living one nine three six and anthem one nine three eight while we the living met with mixed reviews in the u s and positive reviews in the u k anthem received significiant and positive reviews only in england due in part to its odd publication history she was up against the red decade in america and anthem did not even find a publisher in the united states it was first published in england besides rand had still not perfected her literary style and these novels cannot be considered representative without rand s knowledge or permission we the living was made into a pair of films noi vivi and addio kira in one nine four two by scalara films rome they were nearly censored by the italian government under benito mussolini but they were permitted because the novel upon which they were based was anti soviet the films were successful and the public easily realized that they were as much against fascism as communism and the government banned them quickly thereafter these films were re edited into a new version which was approved by rand and re released as we the living in one nine eight six rand s first major professional success came with her best selling novel the fountainhead one nine four three which she wrote over a period of seven years the novel was rejected by twelve publishers who thought it was too intellectual and opposed to the mainstream of american thought it was finally accepted by the bobbs merrill company publishing house thanks mainly to a member of the editorial board archibald ogden who praised the book in the highest terms and finally prevailed eventually the fountainhead was a worldwide success bringing rand fame and financial security the theme of the fountainhead is individualism and collectivism in man s soul it features the lives of five main characters the hero howard roark is rand s ideal a noble soul par excellence an architect who is firmly and serenely devoted to his own ideals and believes that no man should copy the style of another in any field especially architecture all the other characters in the novel demand that he renounce his values but roark maintains his integrity unlike traditional heroes who launch into long and passionate monologues about their integrity and the unfairness of the world roark in contrast does it with a disdainful almost contemptuous taciturnity and laconicism rand s magnum opus atlas shrugged was published in one nine five seven becoming an international bestseller atlas shrugged is often seen as rand s most complete statement of the objectivist philosophy in any of her works of fiction in its appendix she offered this summary my philosophy in essence is the concept of man as a heroic being with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life with productive achievement as his noblest activity and reason as his only absolute the theme of atlas shrugged is the role of man s mind in society rand upheld the industrialist as one of the most admirable members of any society and fiercely opposed the popular resentment accorded to industrialists this led her to envision a novel wherein the industrialists of america go on strike and retreat to a mountainous hideaway the american economy and its society in general slowly start to collapse the government responds by increasing the already stifling controls on industrial concerns the novel deals with issues as complex and divergent as sex music medicine politics and human ability along with nathaniel branden his wife barbara and others including alan greenspan and leonard peikoff jokingly designated the collective rand launched the objectivist movement to promote her philosophy the objectivist movement main article the objectivist movement in one nine five zero rand moved to new york city where in one nine five one she met the young psychology student nathaniel branden who had read her book the fountainhead at the age of one four branden then one nine enjoyed discussing rand s emerging objectivist philosophy with her together branden and some of his other friends formed a group that they dubbed the collective which included some participation by future federal reserve chairman alan greenspan after several years rand and branden s friendly relationship blossomed into a romantic affair despite the fact that both were married at the time their spouses were both convinced to accept this affair but it eventually led to the separation and then divorce of nathaniel branden from his wife although one of rand s most strident philosophical points was never to bow to societal pressure or norms ayn rand abandoned her own name see top of page as did branden born nathan blumenthal throughout the one nine six zero s and one nine seven zero s rand developed and promoted her objectivist philosophy through both her fiction and non fiction works and by giving talks at several east coast universities largely through the nathaniel branden institute the nbi which branden established to promote her philosophy after a convoluted series of separations rand abruptly ended her relationship with both nathaniel branden and his wife barbara branden in one nine six eight when she learned of nathaniel branden s affair with patrecia scott this later affair did not overlap chronologically with the earlier branden rand affair rand refused to have any further dealings with the nbi she then published a letter in the objectivist announcing her repudiation of branden for various reasons including dishonesty but did not mention their affair or her role in the schism the two never reconciled and branden remained a persona non grata in the objectivist movement one nine nine nine u s postage stamp honoring rand art by nick gaetano barbara branden presented an account of the breakup of the affair in her book the passion of ayn rand she describes the encounter between nathaniel and rand saying that rand slapped him numerous times and denounced him in these words if you have an ounce of morality left in you an ounce of psychological health you ll be impotent for the next twenty years and if you achieve any potency you ll know it s a sign of still worse moral degradation conflicts continued in the wake of the break with branden and the subsequent collapse of the nbi many of her closest collective friends began to part ways and during the late seven zero s her activities within the formal objectivist movement began to decline a situation which increased after the death of her husband in one nine seven nine one of her final projects was work on a television adaptation of atlas shrugged rand died of heart failure on march six one nine eight two in new york city years after having successfully battled cancer and was interred in the kensico cemetery valhalla new york grave marker of frank o connor and ayn rand philosophical influences rand rejected virtually all other philosophical schools she acknowledged a shared intellectual lineage with aristotle and john locke and more generally with the philosophies of the age of enlightenment and the age of reason she occasionally remarked with approval on specific philosophical positions of e g baruch spinoza and thomas aquinas she seems also to have respected the american rationalist brand blanshard however she regarded most philosophers as at best incompetent and at worst downright evil she singled out immanuel kant as the most influential of the latter sort nonetheless there are connections between rand s views and those of other philosophers she acknowledged that she had been influenced at an early age by the writings of friedrich nietzsche though she later repudiated his thought and reprinted her first novel we the living with some wording changes in one nine five nine her own thought grew out of critical interaction with it generally her political thought is in the tradition of classical liberalism she expressed qualified enthusiasm for the economic thought of ludwig von mises and henry hazlitt though not mentioned as an influence by her specifically parallels between her works and ralph waldo emerson s essay self reliance do exist later objectivists such as richard salsman have claimed that rand s economic theories are implicitly more supportive of the doctrines of jean baptiste say though rand herself was likely not acquainted with his work politics and house committee on un american activities testimony rand s political views were radically pro capitalist anti statist and anti communist her writings praised above all the human individual and the creative genius of which one is capable she exalted what she saw as the heroic american values of egoism and individualism rand also had a strong dislike for mysticism religion and compulsory charity all of which she believed helped foster a crippling culture of resentment towards individual human happiness and success rand detested many prominent liberal and conservative politicians of her time even including prominent anti communist crusaders like presidents harry s truman and ronald reagan and senators hubert h humphrey and joseph mccarthy although she argued that mccarthyism was a myth and that the accusation of mccarthyism was used as an ad hominem argument to discredit anti communists in one nine four seven during the red scare rand testified as a friendly witness before the house committee on un american activities see rand s testimony involved analysis of the one nine four three film song of russia while many believe that ayn rand disclosed the names of members of the communist party in the u s thus exposing them to blacklisting her testimony consisted entirely of comments regarding the disparity between her experiences in the soviet union and the fanciful portrayal of it in the film rand argued that the movie grossly misrepresented the socioeconomic conditions in the soviet union she told the committee that the film presented life in the ussr as being much better than it actually was apparently this one nine four three film was intentional wartime propaganda by u s patriots trying to put their soviet allies in world war ii under the best possible light after the huac hearings when ayn rand was asked about her feelings on the effectiveness of their investigations she described the process as futile legacy rand s funeral was attended by some of her prominent followers including alan greenspan a six foot floral arrangement in the shape of a dollar sign was placed near her casket in one nine eight five leonard peikoff a surviving member of the collective and ayn rand s designated heir established the ayn rand institute the center for the advancement of objectivism ari the institute has since registered the name ayn rand as a trademark despite rand s desire that her name never be used to promote the philosophy she developed rand expressed her wish to keep her name and the philosophy of objectivism separate to ensure the survival of her ideas another schism in the movement occurred in one nine eight nine when objectivist david kelley wrote a question of sanction in which he defended his choice to speak to non objectivist libertarian groups kelley stated that objectivism was not a closed system and should engage with other philosophies peikoff in an article for the intellectual activist called fact and value argued that objectivism is indeed a closed system and that truth and moral goodness are directly related peikoff expelled kelley from his movement whereupon kelley founded the institute for objectivist studies now known as the objectivist center rand and objectivism are less well known outside north america although there are pockets of interest in europe and australia and her novels are reported to be popular in india and to be gaining an increasingly wider audience in africa her work has had little effect on academic philosophy for her followers are with some notable exceptions drawn from the non academic world neil peart the drummer and lyricist with the canadian progressive rock band rush was influenced by rand philosophy during the early years of the band the most notable instances of this are the track anthem from the album fly by night one nine seven five and the title track from the album two one one two one nine seven six controversy rand s views are controversial religious and socially conservative thinkers have criticized her atheism many adherents and practitioners of continental philosophy criticize her celebration of rationality and self interest within the dominant philosophical movement in the english speaking world analytic philosophy rand s work has been mostly ignored no leading research university in this tradition considers rand or objectivism to be an important philosophical specialty or research area as is documented by brian leiter s report some academics however are trying to bring rand s work into the mainstream for instance the ayn rand society founded in one nine eight seven is affiliated with the american philosophical association in two zero zero six cambridge university press will publish a volume on rand s ethical theory written by ari affiliated scholar tara smith a notable exception to the general lack of attention paid to rand is the essay on the randian argument by harvard university philosopher robert nozick which appears in his collection socratic puzzles nozick s own libertarian political conclusions are similar to rand s but his essay criticizes her foundational argument in ethics which claims that one s own life is for each individual the only ultimate value because it makes all other values possible to make this argument sound nozick argues that rand still needs to explain why someone could not rationally prefer the state of eventually dying and having no values thus he argues her attempt to deduce the morality of selfishness is essentially an instance of assuming the conclusion or begging the question and that her solution to david hume s famous is ought problem is unsatisfactory nevertheless nozick respected rand as an author and noted that he found her books enjoyable and thought provoking rand has sometimes been viewed with suspicion for her practice of presenting her philosophy in fiction and non fiction books aimed at a general audience rather than publishing in peer reviewed journals rand s defenders note that she is part of a long tradition of authors who wrote philosophically rich fiction including dante john milton fyodor dostoevsky and albert camus and that other philosophers such as jean paul sartre presented their philosophies in both fictional and non fictional forms other critics argue that rand s idealistic philosophy and her romantic literary style are not applicable to the inhabited world in particular these critics claim that rand s novels are made up of unrealistic and one dimensional characters they criticize the portrayal of the objectivist heroes as incredibly intelligent unencumbered by doubt wealthy and free of flaws in contrast to the frequent portrayal of the antagonists as weak pathetic full of uncertainty and lacking in imagination and talent defenders of rand point out counterexamples to these criticisms neither eddie willers nor cherryl taggart both positive characters is especially gifted or intelligent but both are characters of dignity and respect leo kovalensky suffers enormously due to his inability to cope with the brutality and banality of communism andrei taganov dies after realizing his philosophical errors dominique francon is initially bitterly unhappy because she believes evil is powerful hank rearden is torn by inner emotional conflict brought on by a philosophical contradiction and dagny taggart thinks that she alone is capable of saving the world two of her main protagonists howard roark and john galt did not begin life wealthy though rand believed that under capitalism valuable contributions will routinely be rewarded by wealth she certainly did not think that wealth made a person virtuous in fact she presents many vicious bureaucrats and waspish elitists who use statism to accumulate money and power moreover hank rearden is exploited because of his social na vet as for the purportedly weak and pathetic villains rand s defenders point out that ellsworth toohey is represented as being a great strategist and communicator from an early age and dr robert stadler is a brilliant scientist rand herself replied to these literary criticisms and in advance of much of them with her essay the goal of my writing one nine six three there and in other essays collected in her book the romantic manifesto a philosophy of literature two nd rev ed one nine seven five rand makes it clear that her goal is to project her vision of an ideal man not man as he is but man as he might and ought to be rand s views on sex have also led to some controversy according to her for a woman qua woman the essence of femininity is hero worship the desire to look up to man one nine six eight some in the bdsm community see her work as relevant and supportive particularly the fountainhead another source of controversy is rand s view that homosexuality is immoral and disgusting as well as her support for the right of businesses to discriminate on the basis of homosexuality such as in their hiring practices specifically she stated that there is a psychological immorality at the root of homosexuality because it involves psychological flaws corruptions errors or unfortunate premises on the topic of non governmental discrimination rand s defenders argue that her support for its legality was motivated by holding property rights above civil or human rights as she did not believe that human rights were distinct from property rights so it did not constitute an endorsement of the morality of the prejudice itself in support of this they cite rand s opposition to some prejudices though not homophobia on moral grounds in essays like racism and global balkanization while still arguing for the right of individuals and businesses to act on such prejudice

is the second largest gas exporter it ranks fourteenth for oil reserves algiers efforts to reform one of the most centrally planned economies in the arab world stalled in one nine nine two as the

the spike in oil prices in one nine nine nine two zero zero zero and the government s tight fiscal policy as well as a large increase in the trade surplus and the near tripling of foreign exchange reserves has helped the country s finances however an ongoing drought the after effects of the november one zero two zero zero one floods and an uncertain oil market make prospects for two zero zero two zero three more problematic the government pledges to continue its efforts to diversify the economy by attracting foreign and domestic investment outside the energy sector however it has thus far had little success in reducing high unemployment officially estimated at three zero and improving living standards president bouteflika has announced sweeping economic reforms which if implemented will significantly restructure the economy still the economy remains heavily dependent on volatile oil and gas revenues the government has continued efforts to diversify the economy by attracting foreign and domestic investment outside the energy sector but has had little success in reducing high unemployment and improving living standards other priority areas include banking reform improving the investment environment and reducing government bureaucracy the government has announced plans to sell off state enterprises sales of a national cement factory and steel plant have been completed and other industries are up for offer in two zero zero one algeria signed an association agreement with the european union it has started accession negotiations for entry into the world trade organization agriculture since roman times algeria has been noted for the fertility of its soil about a quarter of the inhabitants are engaged in agricultural pursuits more than seven five zero zero zero zero zero acres three zero zero zero zero km are devoted to the cultivation of cereal grains the tell is the grain growing land during the time of french rule its productivity was increased substantially by the sinking of artesian wells in districts which only required water to make them fertile of the crops raised wheat barley and oats are the principal cereals a great variety of vegetables and of fruits especially citrus products is exported a considerable amount of cotton was grown at the time of the united states civil war but the industry declined afterwards in the early years of the two zero th century efforts to extend the cultivation of the plant were renewed a small amount of cotton is also grown in the southern oases large quantities of crin vegetal vegetable horse hair an excellent fibre are made from the leaves of the dwarf palm the olive both for its fruit and petroleum and tobacco are cultivated with great success algeria also exports figs dates esparto grass and cork wine production throughout algeria the soil favours the growth of vines the country in the words of an expert sent to report on the subject by the french government can produce an infinite variety of wines suitable to every constitution and to every caprice of taste the growing of vines was undertaken early by the colonists but it was not until vineyards in france were attacked by phylloxera that the export of wine from algeria became significant in one eight eight three despite precautionary measures algerian vineyards were also attacked but in the meantime the quality of their wines had been proved in one eight five zero less than two zero zero zero acres eight km were devoted to the grape but in one eight seven eight this had increased to over four two zero zero zero acres one seven zero km which yielded seven four three six zero zero zero gallons two eight zero zero zero m of wine despite bad seasons and ravages of insects cultivation extended and in one eight nine five the vineyards covered three zero zero zero zero zero acres one two zero zero km the produce being eight eight zero zero zero zero zero zero gallons three three three zero zero zero m the area of cultivation in one nine zero five exceeded four zero zero zero zero zero acres one six zero zero km and in that year the amount of wine produced was one five seven zero zero zero zero zero zero gallons five nine four zero zero zero m by that time the limits of profitable production had been reached in many parts of the country practically the only foreign market for algerian wine is france which in one nine zero five imported about one one zero zero zero zero zero zero zero gallons four one six zero zero zero m fishing fishing is a flourishing but minor industry fish caught are principally sardines bonito smelt and sprats fresh fish are exported to france dried and preserved fish to spain and italy coral fisheries are found along the coast from bona to tunis minerals algeria is rich in minerals the country has many iron lead and zinc copper calamine antimony and mercury mines the most productive are those of iron and zinc lignite is found in algiers immense phosphate beds were discovered near tebessa in one eight nine one yielding three one three five zero zero tons in one nine zero five phosphate beds are also worked near setif guelma and ain beida there are more than three zero zero quarries which produce amongst other stones onyx and beautiful white and red marbles algerian onyx from ain tekbalet was used by the romans and many ancient quarries have been found near kleber some being certainly those from which the long lost numidian marbles were taken salt is collected on the margins of the chotts foreign trade under french administration the commerce of algeria developed greatly the total imports and exports at the time of the french occupation one eight three zero did not exceed one seven five zero zero zero in one eight five zero the figures had reached five zero zero zero zero zero zero in one eight six eight one two zero zero zero zero zero zero in one eight eight zero one seven zero zero zero zero zero zero and in one eight nine zero two zero zero zero zero zero zero zero from this point progress was slower and the figures varied considerably year by year in one nine zero five the total value of the foreign trade was two four five zero zero zero zero zero about five sixths of the trade is with or via france into which country several algerian goods have been admitted duty free since one eight five one and all since one eight six seven french goods except sugar have been admitted into algeria without payment of duty since one eight three five after the increase in one eight nine two of the french minimum tariff which applied to algeria also foreign trade greatly diminished by far algeria s most significant exports financially are petroleum and natural gas the reserves are mostly in the eastern sahara the algerian government curbed the exports in the one nine eight zero s to slow depletion exports increased again somewhat in the one nine nine zero s other significant exports are sheep oxen and horses animal products such as wool and skins wine cereals rye barley oats vegetables fruits chiefly figs and grapes for the table and seeds esparto grass oils and vegetable extracts chiefly olive oil iron ore zinc natural phosphates timber cork crin vegetal and tobacco the import of wool exceeds the export sugar coffee machinery metal work of all kinds clothing and pottery are

well as a few kilometers of its annexed territory western sahara in the west constitutionally it is defined as an islamic arab and amazigh berber country the name algeria is derived from the name of the city of algiers from the arabic word al jaz ir which translates as the islands referring to the four islands which lay off that city s coast until becoming part of the mainland in one five two five history algeria has been inhabited by berbers or amazigh since at least one zero zero zero zero bc from one zero zero zero bc on the carthaginians became an influence on them establishing settlements along the coast berber kingdoms began to emerge most notably numidia and seized the opportunity offered by the punic wars to become independent of carthage only to be taken over soon after by the roman republic in two zero zero bc as the western roman empire collapsed the berbers became independent again in much of the area while the vandals took over parts until later expelled by the generals of the byzantine emperor justinian i the byzantine empire then retained a precarious grip on the east of the country until the coming of the arabs in the eight th century roman arch of trajan at thamugadi timgad algeria after some decades of fierce resistance under leaders such as kusayla and kahina the berbers adopted islam en masse but almost immediately expelled the caliphate from algeria establishing an ibadi state under the rustamids having converted the kutama of kabylie to its cause the shia fatimids overthrew the rustamids and conquered egypt they left algeria and tunisia to their zirid vassals when the latter rebelled and adopted sunnism they sent in a populous arab tribe the banu hilal to weaken them thus incidentally initiating the arabization of the countryside the almoravids and almohads berber dynasties from the west founded by religious reformers brought a period of relative peace and development however with the almohads collapse algeria became a battleground for their three successor states the algerian zayyanids tunisian hafsids and moroccan merinids in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries spain started attacking and taking over many coastal cities prompting some to seek help from the ottoman empire algeria was brought into the ottoman empire by khair ad din and his brother aruj who established algeria s modern boundaries in the north and made its coast a base for the corsairs their privateering peaked in algiers in the one six zero zero s piracy on american vessels in the mediterranean resulted in the first and second barbary war with the united states on the pretext of a slight to their consul the french invaded algiers in one eight three zero however intense resistance from such personalities as emir abdelkader ahmed bey and fatma n soumer made for a slow conquest of algeria not technically completed until the early one nine zero zero s when the last tuareg were conquered constantine algeria one eight four zero meanwhile however the french suppressed slavery and made algeria an integral part of france a status that would end only with the collapse of the fourth republic tens of thousands of settlers from france italy spain and malta moved in to farm the algerian coastal plain and occupy the most prized parts of algeria s cities benefiting from the french government s confiscation of communally held land people of european descent in algeria the so called pieds noirs as well as the native algerian jews were full french citizens starting from the end of the one nine th century by contrast the vast majority of muslim algerians even veterans of the french army remained outside of french law possessing neither french citizenship nor the right to vote algeria s social fabric was stretched to breaking point during this period literacy dropped massively while land confiscation uprooted much of the population in one nine five four the national liberation front fln launched the guerrilla algerian war of independence after nearly a decade of urban and rural warfare they succeeded in pushing france out in one nine six two most of the one zero two five zero zero zero pieds noirs as well as nine one zero zero zero harkis pro french muslim algerians serving in the french army together forming about one zero of the population of algeria in one nine six two fled algeria for france in just a few months in the middle of that year the battle of algiers is a movie about the algerian war of independence algeria s first president the fln leader ahmed ben bella was overthrown by his former ally and defense minister houari boum di nne in one nine six five under ben bella the government had already become increasingly socialist and dictatorial and this trend continued throughout boumedienne s government however boumedienne relied much more heavily on the army and reduced the sole legal party to a merely symbolic role agriculture was collectivised and a massive industrialization drive launched oil extraction facilities were nationalized and this increased the state s wealth especially after the one nine seven three oil crisis but the algerian economy became increasingly dependent on oil bringing hardship when the price collapsed in the one nine eight zero s in foreign policy algeria was a member and leader of the non aligned nations a dispute with morocco over the western sahara nearly led to war dissent was rarely tolerated and the state s control over the media and the outlawing of political parties other than the fln was cemented in the repressive constitution of one nine seven six boum dienne died in one nine seven eight but the rule of his successor chadli bendjedid was little more open the state took on a strongly bureaucratic character and corruption was widespread the modernization drive brought considerable demographic changes to algeria village traditions underwent significant change as urbanization increased new industries emerged agriculture was substantially reduced and education a rarity in colonial times was extended nationwide raising the literacy rate from less than one zero to over six zero improvements in healthcare led to a dramatic increase in the birthrate seven eight children per mother which had two consequences a very youthful population and a housing crisis the new generation struggled to relate to the cultural obsession with the war years and two conflicting protest movements developed left wingers including berber identity movements and islamic int gristes both protested against one party rule but also clashed with each other in universities and on the streets during the one nine eight zero s mass protests from both camps in autumn one nine eight eight forced benjedid to concede the end of one party rule and elections were announced for one nine nine one in december one nine nine one the islamic salvation front won the first round of the country s first multiparty elections the military then canceled the second round forced then president bendjedid to resign and banned the islamic salvation front the ensuing conflict engulfed algeria in the violent algerian civil war more than one zero zero zero zero zero people were killed often in unprovoked massacres of civilians the question of who was responsible for these massacres remains controversial among academic observers many were claimed by the armed islamic group after one nine nine eight the war waned and by two zero zero two the main guerrilla groups had either been destroyed or surrendered taking advantage of an amnesty program though sporadic fighting continued in some areas elections resumed in one nine nine five and in one nine nine nine after a series of short term leaders representing the military abdelaziz bouteflika the current president was elected the issue of berber language and identity increased in significance particularly after the extensive kabyle protests of two zero zero one and the near total boycott of local elections in kabylie the government responded with concessions including naming of tamazight berber as a national language and teaching it in schools politics the head of state is the president of the republic who is elected to a five year term renewable once algeria has universal suffrage the president is the head of the council of ministers and of the high security council he appoints the prime minister who is also the head of government the prime minister appoints the council of ministers the algerian parliament is bicameral consisting of a lower chamber the national people s assembly apn with three eight zero members and an upper chamber the council of nation with one four four members the apn is elected every five years throughout the one nine six zero s algeria supported many independence movements in sub saharan africa and was a leader in the non aligned movement while it shares much of its history and cultural heritage with neighbouring morocco the two countries have had somewhat hostile relations with each other since algeria s independence this is due to two reasons morocco s claim to portions of western algeria which led to the sand war in one nine six three and algeria s support for the polisario an armed group of sahrawi refugees seeking independence for the moroccan ruled western sahara which it hosts within its borders in the city of tindouf tensions between algeria and morocco as well as issues relating to the algerian civil war have put great obstacles in the way of tightening the maghreb arab union nominally established in one nine eight nine but with little practical weight with its coastal neighbors provinces algeria is divided into four eight wilayas provinces geography map of algeria with cities the hoggar mountains most of the coastal area is hilly sometimes even mountainous and there are few good harbours the area just south of the coast known as the tell is fertile further south is the atlas mountain range and the sahara desert algiers oran and constantine are the main cities algeria s climate is arid and hot although the coastal climate is mild and the winters in the mountainous areas can be severe algeria is prone to sirocco a hot dust and sand laden wind especially common in summer see also extreme points of algeria economy algerian coins the fossil fuels energy sector is the backbone of the economy accounting for roughly six zero of budget revenues three zero of gdp and over nine five of export earnings algeria has the fifth largest reserves of natural gas in the world and is the second largest gas exporter it ranks one four th in petroleum reserves algeria s financial and economic indicators improved during the mid one nine nine zero s in part because of policy reforms supported by the imf and debt rescheduling from the paris club algeria s finances in two zero zero zero and two zero zero one benefited from an increase in oil prices and the government s tight fiscal policy leading to a large increase in the trade surplus record highs in foreign exchange reserves and reduction in foreign debt the government s continued efforts to diversify the economy by attracting foreign and domestic investment outside the energy sector has had little success in reducing high unemployment and improving living standards in two zero zero one the government signed an association treaty with the european union that will eventually lower tariffs and increase trade demographics algiers coast about nine zero of algerians live in the northern coastal area the minority who inhabit the sahara desert are mainly concentrated in oases although some one five million remain nomadic or partly nomadic ninety nine percent of the population is classified ethnically as arab berber and religiously as muslim other religions are restricted to extremely small groups mainly of foreigners europeans account for less than one most algerians are arab by language and identity and of mixed berber arab ancestry the berbers inhabited algeria before the arrival of arab tribes during the expansion of islam in the seven th century the issue of ethnicity and language is sensitive after many years of government marginalization of berber or amazigh as some prefer culture today the arab berber issue is often a case of self identification or identification through language and culture rather than a racial or ethnic distinction the two zero or so of the population who self identify as berbers and primarily speak berber languages such as tamazight are divided into several ethnic groups notably kabyle the largest in the mountainous north central area chaoui in the eastern atlas mountains mozabites in the m zab valley and tuareg in the far south language the official language is arabic spoken natively in dialectal form darja by some eight zero of the population the other two zero or so speak berber tamazight officially a national language french is the most widely studied foreign language distantly followed by english but is very rare as a native language since independence the government has pursued a policy of linguistic arabization of education and bureaucracy with some success although many university courses continue to be taught in french culture mosque in algiers modern algerian literature split between arabic and french has been strongly influenced by the country s recent history famous novelists of the two zero th century include mohammed dib and kateb yacine while assia djebar is widely translated important novelists of the one nine eight zero s included rachid mimouni later vice president of amnesty international and tahar djaout murdered by an islamist group in one nine nine three for his

in algeria algerian culture has been strongly influenced by islam the main religion the works of the sanusi family in precolonial times and of emir abdelkader and sheikh ben badis in colonial times are widely noted the algerian musical genre best known abroad is ra a pop flavored opinionated take on folk music featuring international stars such as khaled and cheb mami however in algeria itself the older highly verbal chaabi style remains more popular with such stars as el hadj el anka or dahmane el harrachi while the tuneful melodies of kabyle music exemplified by idir ait menguellet or loun s matoub have a wide audience for more classical tastes andalusi music brought from al andalus by morisco refugees is preserved in many older coastal towns in painting mohammed khadda and m hemed

an elderly woman known only as rearden s mother all of whom he supports gwen ives is his secretary the character of hank rearden has two important roles to play in the novel first he is in the same position as the reader in that he is aware that there is something wrong with the world but is not sure what it is rearden is guided toward an understanding of the solution through his friendship with francisco d anconia who does know the secret and by this mechanism the reader is also prepared to understand the secret when it is revealed explicitly in galt s speech second rearden is used to illustrate rand s theory of sex lillian rearden cannot appreciate hank rearden s virtues and she is portrayed as being disgusted by sex dagny taggart clearly does appreciate rearden s virtues and this appreciation evolves into a sexual desire rearden is torn by a contradiction because he accepts the premises of the traditional view of sex as a lower instinct while responding sexually to dagny who

and one six one and is mentioned in sections one one four and one three one hugh akston identified as one of the last great advocates of reason he was a renowned philosopher and the head of the

on his sister dagny taggart to actually run the railroad but nonetheless opposes her in almost every endeavor in a sense he is the antithesis of dagny as the novel progresses the moral philosophy of the looters is revealed it is a code of nihilism the goal of this code is to not exist to become a zero taggart struggles to remain unaware that this is his goal he maintains his pretence that he wants to live and becomes horrified whenever his mind starts to grasp the truth about himself this contradiction leads to the recurring absurdity of his life the desire to destroy those on whom his life depends and the horror that he will succeed at this james taggart appears in sections one one one one one four one three one one three two one four three one four four one five two and one six one and is mentioned in sections one four six and one four eight john galt the question who is john galt is asked repeatedly throughout atlas shrugged late into the book we learn that john galt is the man who stopped the motor of the world and the leader of the strikers he is also the same character as the mystery worker the son of an ohio garage mechanic galt left home at age one two and began college at patrick henry university at age one six there he befriended francisco d anconia and ragnar danneskj ld all three of whom double majored in physics and philosophy they were the cherished students of the brilliant scientist robert stadler and the brilliant philosopher hugh akston after graduating galt became an engineer at the twentieth century motor works where he designed a revolutionary new motor powered by ambient static electricity with the potential to change the world like ellis wyatt he has created what many had for years said was impossible when the company owners decided to run the factory by the collectivist maxim by each according to his ability to each according to his need galt organized a successful labor strike proclaiming his promise to stop the motor of the world he began traversing the globe meeting the world s most successful businessmen systematically convincing them to follow in his footsteps one by one they began abandoning their business

mulligan had created their own society a secret enclave of rational individualists living in galt s gulch a town secluded high in a wilderness of mountains dagny accidentally finds the town and a shocked john galt by crash landing a light aircraft while pursuing quentin daniels since everyone across the country is repeating the phrase who is john galt it is natural that many people have attempted to answer that question the phrase becomes an expression of helplessness and despair at the current state of the world dagny taggart hears a number of john galt legends before finding the real john galt and eventually joining his cause and learning that all of the stories have an element of truth to them there is a clothing store in vail colorado called john galt ltd one presumes that on occasion a customer unknowingly walks in and asks who is john galt lillian rearden the wildly unsupportive wife of hank rearden they have been married eight years as the novel begins lillian is a frigid moocher who seeks to destroy her husband she compares being rearden s wife with owning the world s most powerful horse since she cannot comfortably ride a horse that goes too fast she must bridle it down to her level even if that means it will never reach its full potential and its power will be greviously wasted lillian also serves to illustrate rand s theory of sex she believes sex is a base animal instinct and that sexual indulgence is a sign of moral weakness she is incapable of feeling this kind of desire which she believes testifies to her moral superiority however according to the theory of sex lillian s lack of sexual capacity results from her inability to experience value in herself she is therefore unable to respond sexually when she experiences value in others lillian tolerates sex with her husband only because she is realistic enough to know he is just a brute who requires satisfaction of his brute instincts in section one six one she indicates that she abhors francisco d anconia because she believes he is a sexual adventurer lillian rearden appears in sections one two one and one six one the looters a group of evil characters sometimes referred to as james

he has never seen before it carries the sign of the dollar in his first appearance the newsstand owner likens the fire of a cigarette to the fire of the mind this alludes to the greek myth of prometheus who gave mankind the gift of fire allowing it to raise itself up and become civilized in atlas shrugged it is the mind of man that raises mankind thus the cigarettes become symbolic of the men of the mind the disappearance of the old brands represents the disappearance of the men of the mind and the newsstand owner s discovery of the new brand foreshadows dagny s discovery of a new kind of men of the mind orren boyle the head of associated steel and a friend of james taggart he is one of the looters he is an investor in the san sebastian mines orren boyle appears or is mentioned in

the head of the state which essentially means that he s the president of the united states though he s never specifically referred to as such in the world of atlas shrugged all presidents and prime ministers are referred to simply as head of the state and mr this is because countries have been standardized as people s states which seem to share a common form of government thomspon s title can thus be seen as reflecting the fact that the us is in the process of evolving into one of these people s states one of the looters he s not particularly intelligent and has a very undistinguished look he knows politics however and is a master of public relations and back room deals rand s notes indicate that she modelled him on president harry s truman wesley mouch a member of the looters and at the beginning of the storyline the incompetent lobbyist whom hank rearden reluctantly employs in washington initially wesley mouch is the least powerful and least significant of the looters the other members of this group feel they can look down upon him with impunity eventually he becomes the most powerful looter and the country s economic dictator thereby illustrating rand s belief that a

ways other than mechanical galt s motor was capable of jamming all radio receivers on earth and completely destroying the contents of galt s booby trapped laboratory without causing collateral structural damage though rand describes it as turning static electricity into useful mechanical work its operation is more reminiscent of modern speculation about zero point energy dagny discovers a

the economy of colorado and of the whole country could collapse wyatt oil is mentioned in sections one one one one three two and one seven one atlas shrugged fictional companies some of the important concepts discussed in atlas shrugged include the sanction of the victim and the theory of sex sanction of the victim the sanction of the victim is defined as the willingness of the good to suffer at the hands of the evil to accept the role of sacrificial victim for the sin of creating values the entire story of atlas shrugged can be seen as an answer to the question what would happen if this sanction was revoked when atlas shrugs relieving himself of the burden of carrying the world he is revoking his sanction the concept is supposedly original in the thinking of ayn rand and is foundational to her moral theory she holds that evil is a parasite on the good and can only exist if the good tolerates it to quote from galt s speech evil is impotent and has no power but that which we let it extort from us and i saw that evil was impotent and the only weapon of its triumph was the willingness of the good to serve it morality requires that we do not sanction our own victimhood rand claims in adhering to this concept rand assigns virtue to the trait of selfishness throughout atlas shrugged numerous characters admit that there is something wrong with the world but they cannot put their finger on what it is the concept they cannot grasp is the sanction of the victim the first person to grasp the concept is john galt who vows to stop the motor of the world by getting the creators of the world to withhold their sanction we first glimpse the concept in section one two one when hank rearden feels he is duty bound to support his family despite their hostility towards him in section one four six the principle is stated explicitly by dan conway i suppose somebody s got to be sacrificed if it turned out to be me i have no right to complain theory of sex in rejecting the traditional christian altruist moral code rand also rejects the sexual code that in her view is a logical implication of altruism rand introduces a theory of sex in atlas shrugged which is purportedly implied by her broader ethical and psychological theories far from being a debasing animal instinct sex is the highest celebration of our greatest values sex is a physical response to intellectual and spiritual values a mechanism for giving concrete expression to values that could otherwise only be experienced in the abstract one is sexually attracted to those who embody one s values those who have base values will be attracted to baseness to those who also have ignoble values those who lack any clear purpose will find sex devoid of meaning people of high values will respond sexually to those who embody high values that our sexual desire is a response to the embodiment of our values in others is a radical and original theory however even those who are sympathetic to this theory have criticized it as being incomplete for instance since according to rand the economy is also such an expression of values and since it is always possible to encounter someone who embodies one s values more completely this would seem to make family undesirable indeed rand treats family as a sort of trap furthermore promiscuity prostitution and an endless round robin of values driven sexual relationships would become inevitable from this viewpoint one could say that aldous huxley portrayed the ideal sexual state brave new world features humans who are incapable of deviating from their caste oriented values which naturally include a code of sexual desirability her sexual theory is illustrated in the contrasting relationships of hank rearden with lillian rearden and dagny taggart and later with dagny taggart and john galt other important illustrations of this theory are found in section one five two recounts dagny s relationship with francisco d anconia section one six one recounts hank and lillian rearden s courtship and lillian s attitude towards sex atlas shrugged this is a list of general items in ayn rand s atlas shrugged anti dog eat dog rule the anti dog eat dog rule is passed by the national alliance of railroads in section one four five allegedly to prevent destructive competition between railroads the rule gives the alliance the authority to forbid competition between railroads in certain parts of the country it was crafted by orren boyle as a favor for james taggart with the purpose of driving the phoenix durango out of colorado bracelet the very first thing made from rearden metal is a bracelet the bracelet is used to illustrate rand s theory of sex the bracelet symbolizes the value created by hank rearden s long struggle to invent rearden metal when he gives it to lillian rearden as a present in section one two one she says it s fully as valuable as a piece of railroad rails however lillian fully grasps the significance of the gift her snide remark is her way of denigrating her husband s ethos in section one six one lillian wears this bracelet at a party thrown on her anniversary she makes fun of it all night long and when dagny taggart hears lillian say she would gladly trade it for a common diamond bracelet dagny takes her up on it lillian later asks for it back upon realizing her power over her husband was slowly diminishing dagny denies the offer the bracelet appears in sections one two one and one six one cub club a night club in new york when francisco d anconia returns to new york in section one four one

equalization of opportunity bill is appears in section one six one galt s gulch a secluded refuge in a valley of colorado where the men of ability have retreated after relinquishing participation in american society nicknamed galt s gulch by its inhabitants it is in fact the property of midas mulligan one of the early strikers to follow john galt s call this call was to the great men of mind and action to abandon the increasingly slave state inclinations of a decaying united states to go on strike thereby withdrawing the only thing supporting the parasites and looters sarcastically nicknamed midas in the press because everything he seemed to touch turned to gold mulligan adopted the nickname during his explosive investment career before dropping out of sight he had purchased this land among his far ranging speculative endeavors and subsequently retreated to it upon his disappearance other strikers soon followed him there including john galt renting or buying land for summer retreats as a respite from continuing their search for fellow strikers among the increasingly collapsing american society eventually a society develops in galt s gulch as more people live there year round as the outside world becomes virtually unsafe to visit we are introduced to galt s gulch in the final section of the novel in the first chapter entitled atlantis the people live with each other in completely free society and embody everything which is the thesis of the novel the appropriate values for a society of mankind philosophical moral economic legal aesthetic and sexual among others too numerous to mention we find industrious ambitious happy people continuing their chosen fields of endeavor without the yokes of any taxation or regulation conversely there is a reverence for private property everything transacted is paid for with the re invented currency of solid gold coin struck from the reserves of midas mulligan s bank which now resides in the valley the townspeople receive services from the various heroes we have met throughout the novel who all now reside and produce in the valley they purchase power inexpensively from galt and his invention of the static electricity motor maintain their anonymity from the outside world via galt s invention of the air wave reflection device giving the view from above the camouflage of reflected images of other mountainsides nearby and some attend galt s lectures on physics where he explains his discoveries on new fundamental laws and applied mathematics the people purchase medical treatment from the care of

who has continued to compose in the valley acquire raw materials from the efforts of francisco d anconia s excavations around the valley attend philosophy lectures from the now retired pirate ragnar danneskj ld receive loans from midas mulligan etc rand s description of galt s gulch was inspired by a visit she and her husband frank o connor took to ouray colorado while researching colorado for

of halley s fourth concerto it is mentioned in section one six one john galt legends since everyone across the country is asking who is john galt it is not surprising that some people have come up

the story john galt was a man of inestimable wealth who found the sunken island of atlantis while fighting the worst storm ever wreaked upon the world the sight was so beautiful that having seen it he could never go back to the world so he sank his ship and took his fortune down with him the actual john galt was a man who created something of inestimable value a new motor and who discovered the secret to what was wrong with the world while fighting the most evil social philosophy ever put into practice the world he envisioned was so beautiful that he refused to live in the world that was and disappeared taking the secret of motor with him atlantis the isles of the blessed is a place where no one could enter except those who had the spirit of a hero described in these terms it is the same

uses political pull to get its way james taggart has friends on the national council of metal industries and he gets them to support legislation that will hurt rearden steel and help associated steel the national council of metal industries is mentioned in section one three one patrick henry university the most prestigious university in the world it was attended by john galt francisco d anconia and ragnar danneskjold where they met and became friends hugh akston and robert stadler taught there it is located in cleveland rio norte line a branch of taggart transcontinental that runs from

railroad night operator at age one six it appears in section one five two san sebastian a community built to house the workers of the san sebastian mines and their families as it turns out the houses roads and everything of practical value is built so poorly that the community can be expected to fall apart within a year or two only the church was built to last it is mentioned in section one five two san sebastian line a branch of taggart transcontinental that serves the san sebastian mines in mexico the mines were developed by francisco d anconia and attracted significant investments from james taggart and orren boyle who assumed francisco could be counted on to deliver a winner the san sebastian line is nationalized by the mexican government soon after completion when it is nationalized in section one four two it is referred to as the san sebastian railroad it is mentioned in sections one one four one three one one three two one three three one four two one four three and one five two san sebastian mines san sebastian mines is a copper mining project in mexico founded by francisco d anconia and named after his ancestor sebastian d anconia francisco s reputation as a businessman is so great that investors flock to him begging to invest money in the enterprise investors include james taggart and orren boyle taggart goes so far as to build a new branch of taggart transcontinental the san sebastian line to serve the mines sinking three zero million into the project when the development of the mines appears complete the mexican government nationalizes them as well as the san sebastian line only to discover there is no copper and there never was when taggart tells francisco he considers the mines a rotten swindle section one six one francisco explains that taggart should be pleased with the way he ran the mines he says he put into practice those moral precepts that were accepted around the world the world says it is evil to pursue a profit he got no profit from the worthless mines the world says the purpose of an enterprise is not to produce but to give a livelihood to its employees it produced nothing but created jobs that would never have existed if one was only concerned with developing a real mine the world says the owner is an exploiter and the workers do all the real work he left the enterprise entirely in the hands of the workers and did not burden anyone with his presence the world says need is more important than ability he hired a mining specialist who needed a job very badly but had no ability in short the san sebastian mines were an illustration of what happens when this moral code is put into practice and a warning of what will soon happen to the world as a whole the san sebastian mines appear in sections one one

technique invented by ellis wyatt this has almost single handedly revitalized the economy of colorado the wyatt oil fields appear in sections one one one and one six one atlas shrugged lists of fictional things atlas as told in atlas shrugged atlas carried the world on his shoulders but in the greek myths the titan atlas stands on the earth and holds up the sky in the statues that represent atlas the big round thing on his back represents the heavens which because of the apparent circular motion of the planets around the earth were conceived of as being round some tellings of the atlas myth have him carrying both the earth and the heavens on his back but this appears to be a modern retelling further research might confirm this character names some of the character names are or appear to be puns or have some other significance see also characters in atlas shrugged when asked why so many of her names have syllables with many hard consonants like dag tag den stad rand said that she just liked those sounds ragnar danneskjold sounds like dane s gold a tribute paid by the medieval english to the vikings to bribe them into being peaceful however note skjold means shield not gold however the hero of victor hugo s first novel hans of iceland becomes the first of the counts of danneskj ld in the one nine seven zero s rand told marsha familaro enright that her use of this name was not plagiarism because there really were counts of danneskj ld robert stadler sounds like the german word for state staat dr stadler is a statist in that he believes it appropriate and necessary for the state to fund scientific research francisco d anconia rand s husband was frank o connor john galt the name of a one nine th century scottish novelist though this is apparently coincidental galt is close to geld and gold the name was probably used because it had to be such that it could become proverbial this would not be possible with a long awkward name wesley mouch mouch is exactly what his name sounds like a mooch he has no real virtue or skill but somehow becomes a powerful figure crime common street crime is conspicuously absent in atlas shrugged characters walk the streets with no thought of being mugged or attacked historical figures and events atlas shrugged takes place in a world with a different history from our own but there are some historical figures and events that are mentioned aristotle section one five two francisco d anconia wrote a thesis on the influence of aristotle s theory of the immovable mover dark ages section one six one ragnar danneskjold s piracy is likened to something out of the dark ages inquisition section one five two sebastian d anconia flees spain to escape persecution under the inquisition middle ages section one six one it is said that ragnar danneskjold hides in the norwegian fjords as the vikings did in the middle ages nero section one five two francisco d anconia compares himself to the emperor nero patrick henry section one five two the eponym of patrick henry university vikings section one six one it is said that ragnar danneskjold hides in the norwegian fjords as the vikings did in the middle ages humor in section one five two francisco cracks that the mexican government was promising a roast of pork every sunday for every man woman child and abortion in section one five two francisco lists the various buildings constructed for the workers of the san sebastian mines and notes how they are all poorly built and can be expected to collapse except for the church the church i think will stand they ll need it he quips since the other things are things of value houses roads etc it is ironic that only the church was built to last to rand and her heroes a church is of no real value almost every nation in the world except the united states is referred to as the people s state of and they are all apparently the recipients of relief supplies from the united states in conversation people casually refer to them as the people s state of rather than just say france or norway it is obvious that people would not refer to countries by their formal names in casual conversation we don t call canada the dominion of canada or germany the federal republic of germany so by having her characters do this rand is exercising her dry wit lying the sympathetic characters of atlas shrugged generally do not tell lies with the following exceptions even when they are clearly trying to conceal something they do not rely on overt falsehood even when it is obvious that they could do so without being found out in section one one two brakeman tells dagny taggart he does not recall the name of the song he was whistling or where he heard it in section one four one francisco d anconia tells the press he came to new york because of a hat check girl and the liverwurst at moe s delicatessen in section one five one we learn dagny taggart once lied to her mother about a cut to her lip that francisco had given her this was the only lie she ever told in section one five two dagny taggart asks francisco if richard halley has written a fifth concerto he is evasive and tells her that halley has stopped writing is this a lie in section one six one hank rearden tells dagny that he was the one who invited bertram scudder to the rearden s anniversary party it was actually lillian who invited him and rearden had been furious about it in part two chapter nine eddie willers tells dagny taggart that his hesitation and uncertainty is caused by the illegality of her directions in fact eddie was shocked by the evidence and thus realization of her affair with hank rearden people s states almost every nation that is mentioned other than the united states is referred to as a people s state these include the people s state of england the people s state of france the people s state of india the people s state of mexico the people s state of norway the people s state of portugal the people s state of turkey the leaders of these countries are given the title the head of the people s state and called mr or senor the president of the united states is refered to as mr thompson and called the head of the state which seems to imply the us is on its way to becoming a people s state as well religion in section one five two francisco tells dagny he named the san sebastian mines after his ancestor sebastian d anconia a man they both honor deeply this to dagny is blasphemy the only kind of blasphemy she understands social classes rand is sometimes called an elitist this claim is probably accurate if we allow for the fact that rand had her own standard of eliteness throughout atlas shrugged virtue is equated with creative ability it is however worth noting that in atlas shrugged there are no characters with creative ability which do not function as author surrogate characters most notably dagny taggart conversely all of the characters which disagree with the author are unintelligent and creatively bankrupt and usually actively destructive compare to the real world where scientists inventors artists and industrialists often have wildly varying and strongly conflicting desires and opinions different social classes are represented among both the heroes and the villains of atlas shrugged among the heroes john galt and hank rearden are from working class backgrounds while dagny taggart and francisco d anconia are from wealthy families among the villains fred kinnan is from a working class background while james taggart and betty pope are from wealthy families atlas shrugged atlas shrugged cover by nick gaetano atlas shrugged is a novel by russian born writer and philosopher ayn rand first published in one nine five seven in the usa and rand s last work of fiction before concentrating her writings exclusively on philosophy most regard atlas shrugged as rand s most famous work her tour de force and most objectivists hold it to be objectively as in factually the greatest novel of all time its theme as stated by rand is the importance of the individual s reasoning mind in human life it is a highly philosophical and allegorical story that deals with themes of rand s own objectivism though she was not yet known as a philosopher when it was written whether or not she had philosophical intentions and to what extent or sense the novel is an allegory are controversial subjects in fact the ideas behind the book and their extremism as well as its relative popularity have made it one of the most controversial novels of the two zero th century it is also one of the longest novels ever written totaling one thousand pages or more depending on the publication philosophy and writing the theme of atlas shrugged is that independent rational thought is the motor that powers the world in the book men of the mind go on strike allowing the collapse of what only they hold together a peaceful cohesiveness rand claims that humans particularly those whose productive work comes from mental effort may create wherever forceful human interference is absent given no alternative they remove themselves from the looters the title is an analogy the rational men like the greek god atlas hold the world on their shoulders in the form of a strike they have chosen to shrug the book is rooted in objectivism the philosophical system founded by rand rand suggests that society stagnates when independence and individual achievement are discouraged or demonized and that inversely a society will become more prosperous as it allows encourages and rewards independence and individual achievement rand believed that independence flourishes to the extent that people are free and that achievement is rewarded best when private property is respected strictly she advocated laissez faire capitalism as the political system that is most consistent with these beliefs these considerations make atlas shrugged a highly political book especially in its portrayal of fascism socialism and communism or indeed any form of state intervention in societal affairs as fatally flawed however rand claimed that it is not a fundamentally political book but that the politics portrayed in the novel are a result of her attempt to display her image of the ideal man and the position of the human mind in society rand argues that independence and individual achievement drive the world and should be embraced her worldview requires a rational moral code she disputes the notion that self sacrifice is a virtue and is similarly dismissive of human faith in a god or higher being the book positions itself against christianity specifically often directly within the characters dialogue setting exactly when atlas shrugged is meant to take place is kept deliberately vague in section one five two the population of new york city is given as seven million the historical new york city reached seven million people in the one nine three zero s which might place the novel sometime after that there are many early two zero th century technologies available but the political situation is clearly different from actual history one interpretation is that the novel takes place a hundred or perhaps hundreds of years in the future implying that since the world lapsed into its socialistic morass a global wide stagnation has occurred in technological growth population growth and indeed growth of any kind the wars economic depressions and other events of the two zero th century would be a distant memory to all but scholars and academicians this would be in line with rand s ideas and commentary on other novels depicting utopian and dystopian societies furthermore this is also in line with an excerpt from a one nine six four interview with playboy magazine in which rand states what we have today is not a capitalist society but a mixed economy that is a mixture of freedom and controls which by the presently dominant trend is moving toward dictatorship the action in atlas shrugged takes place at a time when society has reached the stage of dictatorship when and if this happens that will be the time to go on strike but not until then thus implying that her novel takes place at some point in the future the concept of societal stagnation in the wake of collectivist systems is central to the plot of another of rand s works anthem all countries outside the us have become or become during the novel people s states there are many examples of early two zero th century technology in atlas shrugged but no post war advances such as nuclear weapons helicopters or computers jet planes are mentioned briefly as being a relatively new technology television is a novelty that has yet to assume any cultural significance while radio broadcasts are prominent though rand does not use in the book many of the technological innovations available while she was writing she introduces some advanced fictional inventions e g sound based weapons of mass destruction torture devices as well as power plants most of the action in atlas shrugged occurs in the united states however there are important events around the world such as in the people s states of mexico chile and argentina and piracy at sea plot a section by section analysis of atlas shrugged is available on wikibooks the novel s plot split into three sections though the story is coherent apart from these is extremely complex the first two sections and to some extent the last follow dagny taggart a no nonsense railroad executive and her attempt to keep the company alive despite the fact that society is falling towards collectivism altruism statism all throughout the novel people repeat a platitude dagny greatly resents who is john galt it is a reflection of their helplessness as the saying means don t ask important questions because they don t have answers the geniuses of the world seem to be disappearing and the apparent decline of civilization is making it more and more difficult for her to sustain her life long aspirations of running the trans continental railroad which has been in her family for several generations she deals with other characters such as hank rearden a self made businessman of great integrity whose career is hindered by his false feelings of obligation towards his wife francisco d anconia dagny s childhood friend first love and king of the copper industry appears to have become a worthless playboy who is purposely destroying his business as the novel progresses the myths about the real john galt as well as francisco d anconia s actions become more and more a reflection of the state of the culture and seem to make more and more sense and hank and dagny begin to experience the futility of their attempts to survive in a society that hates them and those like them for their greatness during their plight dagny and hank find the remnants of a motor that turns atmospheric energy into kinetic energy an astounding feat they also find evidence that the minds the atlases of the world are disappearing because of one particular destroyer taking them away dagny and hank deal with the irrationalities and apparent contradictions of their atmosphere and search for the creator of the motor as well as the destroyer who is draining the world of its prime movers in an effort to secure their ability to live rational lives all of this leads to an elaborate action based explanation and eventual climax presenting an understanding of all of the issues explored and breaking everything down into one basic conflict the final parts of the novel involve a speech by the story s true protagonist and a resolution concerning the fate of society the question who is john galt is also answered characters minor

five seven books atlas shrugged novels philosophical novels books critical of christianity books by ayn rand anthropology from the greek word human or person consists of the study of humanity see genus homo it is holistic in two senses it is concerned with all humans at all times and with all dimensions of humanity a primary trait that traditionally distinguished anthropology from other humanistic disciplines is an emphasis on cultural relativity indepth examination of context and cross cultural comparisons in north america anthropology is traditionally divided into four sub disciplines physical anthropology or biological anthropology which studies primate behavior human evolution osteology forensics and population genetics cultural anthropology called social anthropology in the united kingdom and now often known as socio cultural anthropology areas studied by cultural anthropologists include social networks diffusion social behavior kinship patterns law politics ideology religion beliefs patterns in production and consumption exchange socialization gender and other expressions of culture with strong emphasis on the importance of fieldwork or participant observation i e living among the social group being studied for an extended period of time linguistic anthropology which studies variation in language across time and space the social uses of language and the relationship between language and culture and archaeology that studies the material remains of human societies archaeology itself is normally treated as a separate but related field in the rest of the world although closely related to the anthropological field of material culture which deals with physical objects created or used within a living or past group as mediums of understanding its cultural values more recently some anthropology programs began dividing the field into two one emphasizing the humanities and critical theory the other emphasizing the natural sciences and empirical observation historical and institutional context main article history of anthropology the anthropologist t j brewer once characterized anthropology as the most scientific of the humanities and the most humanistic of the sciences understanding how anthropology developed contributes to understanding how it fits into other academic disciplines contemporary anthropologists claim a number of earlier thinkers as their forebearers and the discipline has several sources however anthropology can best be understood as an outgrowth of the age of enlightenment it was during this period that europeans attempted systematically to study human behavior traditions of jurisprudence history philology and sociology developed during this time and informed the development of the social sciences of which anthropology was a part at the same time the romantic reaction to the enlightenment produced thinkers such as herder and later wilhelm dilthey whose work formed the basis for the culture concept which is central to the discipline institutionally anthropology emerged from natural history expounded by authors such as buffon this was the study of human beings typically people living in european colonies thus studying the language culture physiology and artifacts of european colonies was more or less equivalent to studying the flora and fauna of those places it was for this reason for instance that lewis henry morgan could write monographs on both the league of the iroquois and the american beaver and his works this is also why the material culture of civilized nations such as china have historically been displayed in fine arts museums alongside european art while artifacts from africa or native north american cultures were displayed in natural history museums with dinosaur bones and nature dioramas this being said curatorial practice has changed dramatically in recent years and it would be wrong to see anthropology as merely an extension of colonial rule and european chauvinism since its relationship to imperialism was and is complex anthropology grew increasingly distinct from natural history and by the end of the nineteenth century the discipline began to crystallize into its modern form by one nine three five for example it was possible for t k penniman to write a history of the discipline entitled a hundred years of anthropology early anthropology was dominated by the comparative method it was assumed that all societies passed through a single evolutionary process from the most primitive to most advanced non european societies were thus seen as evolutionary living fossils that could be studied in order to understand the european past scholars wrote histories of prehistoric migrations which were sometimes valuable but often also fanciful it was during this time that europeans first accurately traced polynesian migrations across the pacific ocean for instance although some of them believed it originated in egypt finally the concept of race was actively discussed as a way to classify and rank human beings based on inherent biological difference in the twentieth century academic disciplines began to organize around three main domains the sciences seeks to derive natural laws through reproducible and falsifiable experiments the humanities reflected an attempt to study different national traditions in the form of history and the arts as an attempt to provide people in emerging nation states with a sense of coherence the social sciences emerged at this time as an attempt to develop scientific methods to address social phenomena in an attempt to provide a universal basis for social knowledge anthropology does not easily fit into one of these categories and different branches of anthropology draw on one or more of these domains drawing on the methods of the natural sciences as well as developing new techniques involving not only structured interviews but unstructured participant observation and drawing on the new theory of evolution through natural selection they proposed the scientific study of a new object humankind conceived of as a whole crucial to this study is the concept culture which anthropologists defined both as a universal capacity and propensity for social learning thinking and acting which they see as a product of human evolution and something that distinguishes homo sapiens and perhaps all species of genus homo from other species and as a particular adaptation to local conditions that takes the form of highly variable beliefs and practices thus culture not only transcends the opposition between nature and nurture it transcends and absorbs the peculiarly european distinction between politics religion kinship and the economy as autonomous domains anthropology thus transcends the divisions between the natural sciences social sciences and humanities to explore the biological linguistic material and symbolic dimensions of humankind in all forms anthropology in the u s anthropology in the united states was pioneered by staff of the bureau of indian affairs and the smithsonian institution s bureau of american ethnology such as john wesley powell and frank hamilton cushing academic anthropology was established by franz boas who used his positions at columbia university and the american museum of natural history to train and develop multiple generations of students boasian anthropology was politically active and suspicious of research dictated by the u s government or wealthy patrons it was also rigorously empirical and skeptical of over generalizations and attempts to establish universal laws boas studied immigrant children in order to demonstrate that biological race was not immutable and that human conduct and behavior was the result of nurture rather than nature drawing on his german roots he argued that the world was full of distinct cultures rather than societies whose evolution could be measured by how much or how little civilization they had boas felt that each culture has to be studied in its particularity and argued that cross cultural generalizations like those made in the natural sciences were not possible in doing so boas fought discrimination against immigrants african americans and native north americans many american anthropologists adopted boas agenda for social reform and theories of race continue to be popular targets for anthropologists today boas s first generation of students included alfred kroeber robert lowie edward sapir and ruth benedict all of these scholars produced richly detailed studies which described native north america in doing so they provided a wealth of details used to attack the theory of a single evolutionary process kroeber and sapir s focus on native american languages also helped establish linguistics as a truly general science and free it from its historical focus on indo european languages the publication of alfred kroeber s textbook anthropology marked a turning point in american anthropology after three decades of amassing material the urge to generalize grew this was most obvious in the culture and personality studies carried out by younger boasians such as margaret mead and ruth benedict influenced by psychoanalytic psychologists such as sigmund freud and carl jung these authors sought to understand the way that individual personalities were shaped by the wider cultural and social forces in which they grew up while such works as coming of age in samoa and the chrysanthemum and the sword remain popular with the american public mead and benedict never had the impact on the discipline of anthropology that some expected boas had planned for ruth benedict to succeed him as chair of columbia s anthropology department but she was sidelined by ralph linton and mead was limited to her offices at the amnh anthropology in britain whereas boas picked his opponents to pieces through attention to detail in britain modern anthropology was formed by rejecting historical reconstruction in the name of a science of society that focused on analyzing how societies held together in the present the two most important names in this tradition were alfred reginald radcliffe brown and bronislaw malinowski both of whom released seminal works in one nine two two radcliffe brown s initial fieldwork in the andaman islands was carried out in the old style but after reading mile durkheim he published an account of his research entitled simply the andaman islanders which drew heavily on the french sociologist over time he developed an approach known as structural functionalism which focused on how institutions in societies worked to balance out or create an equilibrium in the social system to keep it functioning harmoniously malinowski on the other hand advocated an unhyphenated functionalism which examined how society functioned to meet individual needs malinowski is best known not for his theory however but for his detailed ethnography and advances in methodology his classic argonauts of the western pacific advocated getting the native s point of view and an approach to field work that became standard in the field malinowski and radcliffe brown s success stem from the fact that they like boas actively trained students and aggressively built up institutions which furthered their programmatic ambitions this was particularly the case with radcliffe brown who spread his agenda for social anthropology by teaching at universities across the commonwealth from the late one nine three zero s until the post war period a string of monographs and edited volumes appeared which cemented the paradigm of british social anthropology famous ethnographies include the nuer by edward evan evans pritchard and the dynamics of clanship among the tallensi by meyer fortes while well known edited volumes include african systems of kinship and marriage and african political systems anthropology in france anthropology in france has a less clear genealogy than the british and american traditions most commentators consider marcel mauss to be the founder of the french anthropological tradition mauss was a member of durkheim s annee sociologique group and while durkheim and others examined the state of modern societies mauss and his collaborators such as henri hubert and robert hertz drew on ethnography and philology to analyze societies which were not as differentiated as european nation states in particular mauss s essay on the gift was to prove of enduring relevance in anthropological studies of exchange and reciprocity throughout the interwar years french interest in anthropology often dovetailed with wider cultural movements such as surrealism and primitivism which drew on ethnography for inspiration marcel griaule and michel leiris are examples of people who combined anthropology with the french avant garde during this time most of what is known as ethnologie was restricted to museums and anthropology had a close relationship with studies of folklore above all however it was claude l vi strauss who helped institutionalize anthropology in france in addition to the enormous influence his structuralism exerted across multiple disciplines l vi strauss established ties with american and british anthropologists at the same time he established centers and laboratories within france to provide an institutional context within anthropology while training influential students such as maurice godelier and francoise heritier who would prove influential in the world of french anthropology much of the distinct character of france s anthropology today is a result of the fact that most anthropology is carried out in nationally funded research laboratories rather than academic departments in universities anthropology after world war two before wwii british social anthropology and american cultural anthropology were still distinct traditions it was after the war that the two would blend to create a sociocultural anthropology in the one nine five zero s and mid one nine six zero s anthropology tended increasingly to model itself after the natural sciences some such as lloyd fallers and clifford geertz focused on processes of modernization by which newly independent states could develop others such as julian steward and leslie white focused on how societies evolve and fit their ecological niche an approach popularized by marvin harris economic anthropology as influenced by karl polanyi and practiced by marshall sahlins and george dalton focused on how traditional economics ignored cultural and social factors in england british social anthropology s paradigm began to fragment as max gluckman and peter worsley experimented with marxism and authors such as rodney needham and edmund leach incorporated l vi strauss s structuralism into their work structuralism also influenced a number of development in one nine six zero s and one nine seven zero s including cognitive anthropology and componential analysis authors such as david schneider clifford geertz and marshall sahlins developed a more fleshed out concept of culture as a web of meaning or signification which proved very popular within and beyond the discipline in keeping with the times much of anthropology became politicized through the algerian war of independence and opposition to the vietnam war marxism became a more and more popular theoretical approach in the discipline by the one nine seven zero s the authors of volumes such as reinventing anthropology worried about anthropology s relevance in the one nine eight zero s issues of power such as those examined in eric wolf s europe and the people without history were central to the discipline books like anthropology and the colonial encounter pondered anthropology s ties to colonial inequality while the immense popularity of theorists such as antonio gramsci and michel foucault moved issues of power and hegemony into the spotlight gender and sexuality became a popular topic as did the relationship between history and anthropology influenced by marshall sahlins again who drew on l vi strauss and fernand braudel to examine the relationship between social structure and individual agency in the late one nine eight zero s and one nine nine zero s authors such as george marcus and james clifford pondered ethnographic authority particularly how and why anthropological knowledge was possible and authoritative ethnographies became more reflexive explicitly addressing the author s methodology and cultural positioning and its influence on their ethnographic analysis this was part of a more general trend of postmodernism that was popular contemporaneously currently anthropologists have begun to pay attention to globalization medicine and biotechnology indigenous rights and the anthropology of europe politics of anthropology anthropology s traditional involvement with nonwestern cultures has involved it in politics in many different ways some political problems arise simply because anthropologists usually have more power than the people they study some have argued that the discipline is a form of colonialist theft in which the anthropologist gains power at the expense of subjects the anthropologist they argue can gain yet more power by exploiting knowledge and artifacts of the people he studies while the people he studies gain nothing or even lose in the exchange an example of this exploitative relationship can been seen in the collaboration in africa prior to world war ii of british anthropologists such as fortes and colonial forces more recently there have been newfound concerns about bioprospecting along with struggles for self representation for native peoples and the repatriation of indigenous remains and material culture other political controversies come from american anthropology s emphasis on cultural relativism and its long standing antipathy to the concept of race the development of sociobiology in the late one nine six zero s was opposed by cultural anthropologists such as marshall sahlins who argued that these positions were reductive while authors such john randal baker continued to develop the biological concept of race into the one nine seven zero s the rise of genetics has proven to be central to developments on this front recently kevin b macdonald criticized boasian anthropology as part of a jewish strategy to facilitate mass immigration and to weaken the west the culture of critique two zero zero two as genetics continues to advance as a science some anthropologists such as luca cavalli sforza have continued to transform and advance notions of race through the use of recent developments in genetics such as tracing past migrations of peoples through their mitcochondial and y chromosomal dna and ancestry informative markers finally anthropology has a history of entanglement with government intelligence agencies and anti war politics boas publicly objected to us participation in world war i and the collaboration of some anthropologists with us intelligence in contrast many of boas anthropologist contemporaries were active in the war effort in some form including dozens who served in the office of strategic services and the office of war information in the one nine five zero s the american anthropological association provided the cia information on the area specialities of its members and a number of anthropologists participated in the u s government s operation camelot during the war in vietnam at the same time many other anthropologists were active in the antiwar movement and passed resolutions in the american anthropological association aaa condemning anthropological involvement in covert operations anthropologists were also vocal in their opposition to the war in iraq although there was no consensus amongst practitioners of the discipline professional anthropological bodies often object to the use of anthropology for the benefit of the state their codes of ethics or statements may proscribe anthropologists from giving secret briefings the british association for social anthropology has called certain scholarships ethically dangerous for example the british association for social anthropology has condemned the cia s pat roberts intelligence scholars program which funds anthropology students at us universities in preparation for them to spy for the united states government the aaa s current statement of professional responsibility clearly states that in relation with their own government and with host governments no secret research no secret reports or debriefings of any kind should be agreed to or given anthropology is the study of human diversity diversity of body and behavior in the past and present anthropology consists of four subfields or subdisciplines physical anthropology studies the diversity of the human body in the past and present it includes how we acquired the structure of our body over time that is human evolution as well as differences and relationships between human populations today and their adaptations to their local environments it also sometimes includes the evolution and diversity of our nearest relatives the primates apes and monkeys cultural anthropology studies the diversity of human behavior in the present this is what most anthropologists do and what most of the public sees when they look at national geographic magazine or the discovery channel on tv cultural anthropologists travel to foreign societies although it is possible to do anthropology on your own society live among the people there and try as much as they can to understand how those people live archaeology studies the diversity of human behavior in the past since it studies how people lived in the past these people are not available for us to visit and talk to or at least not people who are currently living in the same way that their ancestors did in the past therefore archaeologists must depend on the artifacts and features that the people produced in the past and attempt to reconstruct their vanished way of life from the remnants of their culture linguistic anthropology studies the diversity of human language in the past and present while language is naturally a part of culture it is such a huge topic that anthropologists have separated it into its own area of study linguistic anthropologists are concerned about the development of languages perhaps even back to the first forms of language and how language changes over time they are also interested in how different contemporary languages differ today how they are related and how we can learn about things like migration and diffusion from that data they also ask how language is related to and reflects on other aspects of culture other sciences study humans too of course history economics psychology sociology even biology and chemistry can study humans how is anthropology different the answer is the anthropological perspective that is the way that anthropology approaches the subject and thinks about or studies humans and their behavior the anthropological perspective has three components one cross cultural or comparative anthropology investigates humans in every form that they take we are interested to see the entire spectrum of human bodies and behaviors trying to learn the range of humanity all the ways that we can be human by seeing humans in their every manifestation and comparing those manifestations to each other we can ask what is possible for humans and what is necessary for humans two holistic anthropology tries to relate every part of culture to every other part it understands that the various parts of culture are connected to each other and that certain combinations tend to occur or not to occur for example there are no hunting and gathering cultures that traditionally lived in cities that s just impossible we are also interested in how a people s cultures is connected to their environment again without high technology you are not going to see farming or cities in the middle of the desert or the arctic three relativistic this is the most profound yet controversial part of the anthropological perspective relativism means that the rules or norms or values of a culture are relative to that specific culture in other words say monogamy may be normal or preferred in one culture but polygamy may be normal or preferred in another the point is that different cultures believe different things or value different things or even mean different things with perhaps identical looking behaviors or objects when you go to another culture or even just interact with another culture for example when you are doing international business you cannot assume that other people understand things the same way you do in fact you should assume that they don t anthropology counsels against hasty judgement of a new culture aspects that a western visitor may find strange or distasteful can be understood when situated within that culture s history and cosmology understanding of the world there will be a rationality for the phenomenon it may be rational however according to a cultural logic that conflicts with western understandings malinowski s primacy of seeking to understand the native point of view remains fundamental to socio cultural anthropology today the point is that if we want to understand other people properly we must see what their behaviors or words or concepts mean to them not what they would mean to us meaning is relative to the culture that creates that meaning this is not to say that all things are true or even that all things are good cultural relativism does not necessarily entail moral relativism indeed the american anthropological association s qualified support one nine four eight one nine nine seven for the universal declaration of human rights as well as work by sally engle merry shows the latter is not a common anthropological point of view how does anthropology study culture one other way that anthropology is unique among the sciences that study humans is by its emphasis on fieldwork you cannot get to know another culture just by reading about it or watching movies about it at best you could learn what other people have already discovered but you could not learn anything new so anthropology requires actually going to that society and living within their culture as much as possible this is called participant observation this depends crucially on finding preferrably friendly informants within the society who will teach you their culture s rules of social behaviour and include you in their activities then as much as possible you will try to eat their food speak their language and live their lives often actually residing with a family in that society it is not easy work and it is not always fun but there is no better way to learn anthropological fields and subfields biological anthropology also physical anthropology forensic anthropology paleoethnobotany cultural anthropology also social anthropology anthropology of art

the greek words ancient and word speech discourse is the study of human cultures through the recovery documentation and analysis of material remains and environmental data including architecture artifacts biofacts human remains and landscapes the goals of archaeology are to document and explain the origins and development of human culture understand culture history chronicle cultural evolution and study human behavior and ecology for both prehistoric and historic societies it is considered to be one of the four sub fields of anthropology usage as with words such as encyclopedia and gynaecology archaeology traditionally has an ae combination however unlike other words the ae is all but universally retained contrary to popular belief in other parts of the world the spelling archeology is not predominant in united states dictionaries and would look quite odd to most americans like the claim that theater refers to a building and theatre refers to the performing arts the belief that archeology is an americanism is little more than an urban myth the traditional spelling archaeology continues to be used in everyday writing throughout the world including the u s even more so than theatre the alternate spelling of which while considered acceptable is preferred less often than not ontology and definition in the old world archaeology has tended to focus on the study of physical remains the methods used in recovering them and the theoretical and philosophical underpinnings in achieving the subject s goals the discipline s roots in antiquarianism and the study of latin and ancient greek provided it with a natural affinity with the field of history in the new world archaeology is more commonly devoted to the study of human societies and is treated as one of the four subfields of anthropology the other subfields of anthropology supplement the findings of archaeology in a holistic manner these subfields are cultural anthropology which studies behavioural symbolic and material dimensions of culture linguistics which studies language including the origins of language and language groups and physical anthropology which includes the study of human evolution and physical and genetic characteristics other disciplines also supplement archaeology such as paleontology paleozoology paleoethnobotany paleobotany geography geology art history and classics archaeology has been described as a craft that enlists the sciences to illuminate the humanities writing in one nine four eight the american archaeologist walter taylor asserted that archaeology is neither history nor anthropology as an autonomous discipline it consists of a method and a set of specialised techniques for the gathering or production of cultural information archaeology is an approach to understanding human culture through its material remains regardless of chronology in england archaeologists have uncovered the long lost layouts of medieval villages abandoned after the crises of the one four th century and the equally lost layouts of one seven th century parterre gardens swept away by a change in fashion in downtown new york city archaeologists have exhumed the one eight th century remains of the black burial ground traditional archaeology is viewed as the study of pre historical human cultures that is cultures that existed before the development of writing for that culture historical archaeology is the study of post writing cultures in the study of relatively recent cultures which have been observed and studied by western scholars archaeology is closely allied with ethnography this is the case in large parts of north america oceania siberia and other places where the study of archaeology mingles with the living traditions of the cultures being studied kennewick man is an example of archaeology interacting with modern culture in the study of cultures that were literate or had literate neighbours history and archaeology supplement one another for broader understanding of the complete cultural context as at hadrian s wall importance and applicability most of human history is not described by any written records writing did not exist anywhere in the world until about five zero zero zero years ago and only spread among a relatively small number of technologically advanced civilisations in contrast homo sapiens have existed for at least two zero zero zero zero zero years and other species of homo for millions of years see human evolution these civilisations are not coincidentally the best known they have been open to the inquiry of historians for centuries while the study of pre historic cultures has arisen only recently even within a civilisation that is literate at some levels many important human practices are not officially recorded any knowledge of the formative early years of human civilisation the development of agriculture cult practices of folk religion the rise of the first cities must come from archaeology even where written records do exist they are invariably incomplete or biased to some extent in many societies literacy was restricted to the elite classes such as the clergy or the bureaucracy of court or temple the literacy even of an aristocracy has sometimes been restricted to deeds and contracts the interests and world view of elites are often quite different from the lives and interests of the rest of the populace writings that were produced by people more representative of the general population were unlikely to find their way into libraries and be preserved there for posterity thus written records tend to reflect the biases of the literate classes and cannot be trusted as a sole source the material record is nearer to a fair representation of society though it is subject to its own inaccuracies such as sampling bias and differential preservation in addition to their scientific importance archaeological remains sometimes have political significance to descendants of the people who produced them monetary value to collectors or simply strong aesthetic appeal many people identify archaeology with the recovery of such aesthetic religious political or economic treasures rather than with the reconstruction of past societies this view is often espoused in works of popular fiction such as raiders of the lost ark the mummy and king solomon s mines when such unrealistic subjects are treated more seriously accusations of pseudoscience are invariably levelled at their proponents see pseudoarchaeology below however these endeavours real and fictional are not representative of the modern state of archaeology goals there is still a tremendous emphasis in the practice of archaeology on field techniques and methodologies these include the tasks of surveying areas in order to find new sites digging sites in order to unearth the cultural remains therein and classification and preservation techniques in order to analyse and keep these remains every phase of this process can be a source of information the goals of archaeology are not always the same there are at least three broad distinct theories of exactly what archaeological research should do these are beyond the scope of the present discussion and are discussed at length below nevertheless there is much common ground academic sub disciplines main article archaeological sub disciplines as with most academic disciplines there are a very large number of archaeological sub disciplines characterised by a specific method or type of material e g lithic analysis music archaeobotany geographical or chronological focus e g near eastern archaeology medieval archaeology other thematic concern e g landscape archaeology or a specific archaeological culture or civilisation e g egyptology cultural resources management cultural resources management crm also called heritage management in britain is a branch of archaeology that accounts for most research done in the united states and much of that in western europe as well in the united states crm archaeology has been a growing concern since the passage of the national historic preservation act of one nine six six and most of the archaeology done in that country today proceeds from either direct or related requirements of that measure in the united states the vast majority of taxpayers scholars and politicians believe that crm has helped to preserve much of that nation s history and prehistory that would have otherwise been lost in the expansion of cities dams and highways along with other statutes this mandates that no construction project on public land or involving public funds may damage an unstudied archaeological site the application of crm in the united kingdom is not limited to government funded projects since one nine nine zero ppg one six has required planners to consider archaeology as a material consideration in determining applications for new development as a result numerous archaeological organisations undertake mitigation work in advance of or during construction work in archaeologically sensitive areas at the developer s expense among the goals of crm are the identification preservation and maintenance of cultural sites on public and private lands and the removal of culturally valuable materials from areas where they would otherwise be destroyed by human activity such as proposed construction this study involves at least a cursory examination to determine whether or not any significant archaeological sites are present in the area affected by the proposed construction if these do exist time and money must be allotted for their excavation if initial survey and or test excavation indicates the presence of an extraordinarily valuable site the construction may be prohibited entirely crm is a thriving entity especially in the united states and europe where archaeologists from private companies and all levels of government engage in the practice of their discipline cultural resources management has however been criticized crm is conducted by private companies that bid for projects by submitting proposals outlining the work to be done and an expected budget it is not unheard of for the agency responsible for the construction to simply choose the proposal that asks for the least funding crm archaeologists face considerable time pressure often being forced to complete their work in a fraction of the time that might be allotted for a purely scholarly endeavour field methods survey a modern archaeological project often begins with a survey regional survey is the attempt to systematically locate previously unknown sites in a region site survey is the attempt to systematically locate features of interest such as houses and middens within a site each of these two goals may be accomplished with largely the same methods survey was not widely practiced in the early days of archaeology cultural historians and prior researchers were usually content with discovering the locations of monumental sites from the local populace and excavating only the plainly visible features there gordon willey pioneered the technique of regional settlement pattern survey in one nine four nine in the viru valley of coastal peru and survey of all levels became prominent with the rise of processual archaeology some years later survey work has many benefits if performed as a preliminary exercise to or even in place of excavation it requires relatively little time and expense because it does not require processing large volumes of soil to search out artefacts nevertheless surveying a large region or site can be expensive so archaeologists often employ sampling methods it avoids ethical issues of particular concern to descendant peoples associated with destroying a site through excavation it is the only way to gather some forms of information such as settlement patterns and settlement structure survey data are commonly assembled into maps which may show surface features and or artefact distribution the simplest survey technique is surface survey it involves combing an area usually on foot but sometimes with the use of mechanised transport to search for features or artefacts visible on the surface surface survey cannot detect sites or features that are completely buried under earth or overgrown with vegetation surface survey may also include mini excavation techniques such as augers corers and shovel test pits aerial survey is conducted using cameras attached to aircraft balloons or even kites a bird s eye view is useful for quick mapping of large or complex sites aerial imaging can also detect many things not visible from the surface plants growing above a stone structure such as a wall will develop more slowly while those above other types of features such as middens may develop more rapidly photographs of ripening grain which changes colour rapidly at maturation have revealed buried structures with great precision aerial survey also employs infrared ground penetrating radar wavelengths and thermography geophysical survey is the most effective way to see beneath the ground magnetometers detect minute deviations in the earth s magnetic field caused by iron artefacts kilns some types of stone structures and even ditches and middens devices that measure the electrical resistivity of the soil are also widely used most soils are moist below the surface which gives them a relatively low resistivity features such as hard packed floors or concentrations of stone have a higher resistivity although some archaeologists consider the use of metal detectors to be tantamount to treasure hunting others deem them an effective tool in archaeological surveying examples of formal archaeological use of metal detectors include musketball distribution analysis on english civil war battlefields metal distribution analysis prior to excavation of a nineteenth century ship wreck and service cable location during evaluation metal detectorists have also contributed to the archaeological record where they have made detailed records of their results and refrained from raising artifacts from their archaeological context in the uk metal detectorists have been solicited for involvement in the portable antiquities scheme regional survey in maritime archaeology uses side scan sonar excavation archaeological excavation existed even when the field was still the domain of amateurs and it remains the source of the majority of data recovered in most field projects it can reveal several types of information usually not accessible to survey such as stratigraphy three dimensional structure and verifiably primary context modern excavation techniques require that the precise locations of objects and features known as their provenance or provenience be recorded this always involves determining their horizontal locations and sometimes vertical position as well also see primary laws of archaeology similarly their association or relationship with nearby objects and features needs to be recorded for later analysis this allows the archaeologist to deduce what artefacts and features were likely used together and which may be from different phases of activity for example excavation of a site reveals its stratigraphy if a site was occupied by a succession of distinct cultures artefacts from more recent cultures will lie above those from more ancient cultures excavation is the most expensive phase of archaeological research also as a destructive process it carries ethical concerns as a result very few sites are excavated in their entirety sampling is even more important in excavation than in survey it is common for large mechanical equipment such as backhoes jcbs to be used in excavation especially to remove the topsoil overburden though this method is increasingly used with great caution following this rather dramatic step the exposed area is usually hand cleaned with trowels or hoes to ensure that all features are apparent the next task is to form a site plan and then use it to help decide the method of excavation features dug into the natural subsoil are normally excavated in portions in order to produce a visible archaeological section for recording scaled plans and sections of individual features are all drawn on site black and white and colour photographs of them are taken and recording sheets are filled in describing the context of each all this information serves as a permanent record of the now destroyed archaeology and is used in describing and interpreting the site post excavation analysis once artefacts and structures have been excavated or collected from surface surveys it is necessary to properly study them to gain as much data as possible this process is known as post excavation analysis and is normally the most time consuming part of the archaeological investigation it is not uncommon for the final excavation reports on major sites to take years to be published at its most basic the artefacts found are cleaned catalogued and compared to published collections in order to classify them typologically and to identify other sites with similar artefact assemblages however a much more comprehensive range of analytical techniques are available through archaeological science meaning that artefacts can be dated and their compositions examined the bones plants and pollen collected from a site can all be analysed using the techniques of zooarchaeology paleoethnobotany and palynology while any texts can usually be deciphered these techniques frequently provide information that would not otherwise be known and therefore contribute greatly to the understanding of a site history of archaeology main article history of archaeology the history of archaeology has been one of increasing professionalisation and the use of an increasing range of techniques to obtain as much data on the site being examined as possible excavations of ancient monuments and the collection of antiquities have been taking place for thousands of years but these were mostly for the extraction of valuable or aesthetically pleasing artefacts it was only in the one nine th century that the systematic study of the past through its physical remains began to be carried out archaeological methods were developed by both interested amateurs and professionals including augustus pitt rivers and william flinders petrie this process was continued in the two zero th century by such people as mortimer wheeler whose highly disciplined approach to excavation greatly improved the quality of evidence that could be obtained during the two zero th century the development of urban archaeology and then rescue archaeology have been important factors as has the development of archaeological science which has greatly increased the amount of data that it is possible to obtain archaeological theory main article archaeological theory there is no single theory of archaeology and even definitions are disputed until the mid two zero th century and the introduction of technology there was a general consensus that archaeology was closely related to both history and anthropology the first major phase in the history of archaeological theory is commonly referred to as cultural or culture history which was developed during the late one nine th and early two zero th centuries in the one nine six zero s a number of young primarily american archaeologists such as lewis binford rebelled against the paradigms of cultural history they proposed a new archaeology which would be more scientific and anthropological with hypothesis testing and the scientific method very important parts of what became known as processual archaeology in the one nine eight zero s a new movement arose led by the british archaeologists michael shanks christopher tilley daniel miller and ian hodder it questioned processualism s appeals to science and impartiality and emphasised the importance of relativism becoming known as post processual archaeology however this approach has been criticised by processualists as lacking scientific rigour the validity of both processualism and post procuessualism is still under debate archaeological theory now borrows from a wide range of influences including neo darwinian evolutionary thought phenomenology postmodernism agency theory cognitive science functionalism gender based and feminist archaeology and systems theory public archaeology early archaeology was largely an attempt to uncover spectacular artifacts and features or to explore vast and mysterious abandoned cities such pursuits continue to fascinate the public portrayed in books such as king solomon s mines and films such as the mummy and raiders of the lost ark much thorough and productive research has indeed been conducted in dramatic locales such as cop n and the valley of the kings but the stuff of modern archaeology is not so reliably sensational in addition archaeological adventure stories tend to ignore the painstaking work involved in modern survey excavation and data processing techniques some archaeologists refer to such portrayals as pseudoarchaeology nevertheless archaeology has profited from its portrayal in the mainstream media many practitioners point to the childhood excitement of indiana jones films and tomb raider games as the inspiration for them to enter the field archaeologists are also very much reliant on public support the question of exactly who they are doing their work for is often discussed without a strong public interest in the subject often sparked by significant finds and celebrity archaeologists it would be a great deal harder for archaeologists to gain the political and financial support they require in the uk popular archaeology programmes such as time team and meet the ancestors have resulted in a huge upsurge in public interest where possible archaeologists now make more provision for public involvement and outreach in larger projects than they once did however the move towards being more professional has meant that volunteer places are now relegated to unskilled labour and even this is less freely available than before developer funded excavation necessitates a well trained staff that can work quickly and accurately observing the necessary health and safety and indemnity insurance issues involved in working on a modern building site with tight deadlines certain charities and local government bodies sometimes offer places on research projects either as part of academic work or as a defined community project there is also a flourishing industry selling places on commercial training excavations and archaeological holiday tours archaeologists prize local knowledge and often liaise with local historical and archaeological societies anyone looking to get involved in the field without having to pay to do so should contact a local group pseudoarchaeology main article pseudoarchaeology pseudoarchaeology is an umbrella term for all activities that claim to be archaeological but in fact violate commonly accepted archaeological practices it includes much fictional archaeological work discussed above as well as some actual activity many non fiction authors have ignored the scientific methods of processual archaeology or the specific critiques of it contained in post processualism an example of this type is the writing of erich von d niken his chariots of the gods one nine six eight together with many subsequent lesser known works expounds a theory of ancient contacts between human civilisation on earth and more technologically advanced extraterrestrial civilisations this theory known as palaeocontact theory is not exclusively d niken s nor did the idea originate with him works of this nature are usually marked by the renunciation of well established theories on the basis of limited evidence and the interpretation of evidence with a preconceived theory in mind looting looting of archaeological sites by people in search of hoards of buried treasure is an ancient problem for instance many of the tombs of the egyptian pharaohs were looted in antiquity the advent of archaeology has made ancient sites objects of great scientific and public interest but it has also attracted unwelcome attention to the works of past peoples a brisk commercial demand for artefacts encourages looting and the illicit antiquities trade which smuggles items abroad to private collectors looters damage the integrity of a historic site deny archaeologists valuable information that would be learnt from excavation and are often deemed to be robbing local people of their heritage the popular consciousness often associates looting with poor third world countries many are former homes to many well known ancient civilizations but lack the financial resources or political will to protect even the most significant sites certainly the high prices that intact objects can command relative to a poor farmer s income make looting a tempting financial proposition for some local people however looting has taken its toll in places as rich and populous as the united states and western europe as well abandoned towns of the ancient sinagua people of arizona clearly visible in the desert landscape have been destroyed in large numbers by treasure hunters sites in more densely populated areas farther east have also been looted where looting is proscribed by law it takes place under cover of night with the metal detector a common instrument used to identify profitable places to dig public outreach motivated by a desire to halt looting curb pseudoarchaeology and to secure greater public funding and appreciation for their work archaeologists are mounting public outreach campaigns they seek to stop looting by informing prospective artefact collectors of the provenance of these goods and by alerting people who live near archaeological sites of the threat of looting and the danger that it poses to science and their own heritage common methods of public outreach include press releases and the encouragement of school field trips to sites under excavation the final audience for archaeologists work is the public and it is increasingly realised that their work is ultimately being done to benefit and inform them the putative social benefits of local heritage awareness are also being promoted with initiatives to increase civic and individual pride through projects such as community excavation projects and better interpretation and presentation of existing sites descendant peoples in the united states examples such as the case of kennewick man have illustrated the tensions between native americans and archaeologists which can be summarised as a conflict between a need to remain respectful towards burials sacred sites and the academic benefit from studying them for years american archaeologists dug on indian burial grounds and other places considered sacred removing artefacts and human remains to storage facilities for further study in some cases human remains were not even thoroughly studied but instead archived rather than reburied furthermore western archaeologists views of the past often differ from those of tribal peoples the west views time as linear for many natives it is cyclic from a western perspective the past is long gone from a native perspective disturbing the past can have dire consequences in the present to an archaeologist the past is long gone and must be reconstructed through its material remains to indigenous peoples it is often still alive as a consequence of this american indians attempted to prevent archaeological excavation of sites inhabited by their ancestors while american archaeologists believed that the advancement of scientific knowledge was a valid reason to continue their studies this contradictory situation was addressed by the native american graves protection and repatriation act nagpra one nine nine zero which sought to reach a compromise by limiting the right of research institutions to possess human remains due in part to the spirit of postprocessualism some archaeologists have begun to actively enlist the assistance of indigenous peoples likely to be descended from those under study archaeologists have also been obliged to re examine what constitutes an archaeological site in view of what native peoples believe to constitute sacred space to many native peoples natural features such as lakes mountains or even individual trees have cultural significance australian archaeologists especially have explored this issue and attempted to survey these sites in order to give them some protection from being developed such work requires close links and trust between archaeologists and the people they are trying to help and at the same time study while this cooperation presents a new set of challenges and hurdles to fieldwork it has benefits for all parties involved tribal elders cooperating with archaeologists can prevent the excavation of areas of sites that they consider sacred while the archaeologists gain the elders aid in interpreting their finds there have also been active efforts to recruit aboriginal peoples directly into the archaeological profession repatriation a new trend in the heated controversy between first nations groups and scientists is the repatriation of native artifacts to the original descendants an example of this occurred june two one two zero zero five when a community members and elders from a number of the one zero algonquian nations in the ottawa area convened on the kitigan zibi reservation in kanawagi quebec to inter ancestral human remains and burial goods some dating back six zero zero zero years the ceremony marked the end of a journey spanning thousands of years and many miles the remains and artifacts including beads tools and weapons were originally excavated from various sites in the ottawa valley including morrison and the allumette islands they had been part of the canadian museum of civilization s research collection for decades some since the late one eight zero zero s elders from various algonquin communities conferred on an appropriate reburial eventually deciding on traditional redcedar and birchbark boxes lined with redcedar chips muskrat and beaver pelts now an inconspicuous rock mound marks the reburial site where close to nine zero boxes of various sizes are buried although negotiations were at times tense between the kitigan zibi community and museum they were able to reach agreement source canadian geographic online see also list of significant

be considered a science of ecoregions because it is closely linked to soil properties and climate which are never exactly the same from one place to another many people think an agricultural production system relying on local weather soil characteristics and specific crops has to be studied locally others feel a need to know and understand production systems in as many areas as possible and the human dimension of interation with nature history of agricultural science main article history of agricultural science agricultural science is seen by some to have began with mendel s insightful genetc work but in modern terms might be better dated from the chemical fertilizer outputs of plant physiological understanding in eighteenth century germany today it is very different from what it was even in one nine five zero intensification of agriculture since the one nine six zero s in developed and developing countries often referred to as the green revolution was closely tied to progress made in selecting and improving crops and animals for high productivity as well as to developing additional inputs such as artificial fertilizers and phytosanitary products as the oldest and largest human intervention in nature the environmental impact of agriculture in general and more recently intensive agriculture industrial development and population growth have raised many questions among agricultural scientists and have led to the development and emergence of new fields these include technological fields that assume the solution to technological problems lies in better technology such as integrated pest management waste treatment technologies landscape architecture genomics and agricultural philosophy fields that include references to food production as something essentially different from non essential eeconomic goods in fact the interaction between these two approaches provide a fertile field for deeper understanding in agricultural science new technologies such as biotechnology and computer science for data processing and storage and technological advances have made it possible to develop new research fields including genetic engineering agrophysics improved statistical analysis and precision farming balancing these as above are the natural and human sciences of agricultural science that seek to understand the human nature interactions of traditional agriculture including interaction of religion and agriculture and the non material components of agricultural production systems prominent agricultural scientists norman borlaug luther burbank louis pasteur gregor mendel ren dumont george washington carver agricultural science and agriculture crisis agriculture sciences seek to feed the world s population while preventing biosafety

agriculture agronomy soil science alchemist s laboratory by hans vredman de vries c one five nine five alchemy is an early protoscientific and philosophical discipline combining elements of chemistry metallurgy physics medicine astrology semiotics mysticism spiritualism and art alchemy has been practiced in ancient egypt india and china in classical greece and rome in the islamic empire and then in europe up to the one nine th century in a complex network of schools and philosophical systems spanning at least two five zero zero years western alchemy has always been closely connected with hermeticism a philosophical and spiritual system that traces its roots to hermes trismegistus a syncretic egyptian greek deity and legendary alchemist these two disciplines influenced the birth of rosicrucianism an important esoteric movement of the one seven th century in the one nine th century as mainstream alchemy evolved into modern chemistry its mystic and hermetic aspects became the focus of a modern spiritual alchemy where material manipulations are viewed as mere symbols of spiritual transformations the alchemists did not follow what is now known as the scientific method and much of the knowledge they produced was later found to be banal limited wrong or meaningless today the discipline is of interest mainly to historians of science and philosophy and for its mystic esoteric and artistic aspects nevertheless alchemy was one of the main precursors of modern sciences and we owe to the ancient alchemists the discovery of many substances and processes that are the mainstay of modern chemical and metallurgical industries overview the alchemist by sir william fettes douglas alchemy as a proto science the common perception of alchemists is that they were pseudo scientists crackpots and charlatans who attempted to turn lead into gold believed that the universe was composed of the four elements of earth air fire and water and spent most of their time concocting miraculous remedies poisons and magic potions this picture is rather unfair although many alchemists were indeed crackpots and charlatans many were well meaning and intelligent scholars who were simply struggling to make sense of a subject which as we now know was far beyond the reach of their tools these people were basically proto scientists who attempted to explore and investigate the nature of chemical substances and processes they had to rely on unsystematic experimentation traditional know how rules of thumb and plenty of speculative thought to fill in the wide gaps in existing knowledge given these conditions the mystic character of alchemy is quite understandable to the early alchemist chemical transformations could only seem like magical phenomena governed by incomprehensible laws whose potential and limitations he had no way of knowing having discovered that a specific procedure could turn an earth like ore into glistening metal it was only natural to speculate that some different procedure could turn a metal into another at the same time it was clear to the alchemists that something was generally being conserved in chemical processes even in the most dramatic changes of physical state and appearance i e that substances contained some principles that could be hidden under many outer forms and revealed by proper manipulation throughout the history of the discipline alchemists struggled very hard to understand the nature of these principles and find some order and sense in the results of their chemical experiments which were often undermined by impure or poorly characterized reagents the lack of quantitative measurements and confusing and inconsistent nomenclature in spite of those difficulties and of many false turns and loops the alchemists managed to make steady progress in the understanding of the natural world to them we owe the discovery of many important substances and chemical processes which paved the way for the modern science of chemistry and are still the mainstay of today s chemical and metallurgical industries alchemy as a philosophical and spiritual discipline the best known goals of the alchemists were the transmutation of common metals into gold or silver and the creation of a panacea a remedy that supposedly would cure all diseases and prolong life indefinitely starting with the middle ages european alchemists invested much effort on the search for the philosopher s stone a mythical substance that was believed to be an essential ingredient for either or both of those goals alchemists enjoyed prestige and support through the centuries though not for their pursuit of those unattainable goals nor the mystic and philosophical speculation that dominates their literature rather it was for their mundane contributions to the chemical industries of the day ore testing and refining metalworking production of ink dyes paints and cosmetics leather tanning ceramics and glass manufacture preparation of extracts and liquors and so on it seems that the preparation of aqua vitae the water of life was a fairly popular experiment among european alchemists on the other hand alchemists never had the intellectual tools nor the motivation to separate the physical chemical aspects of their craft from the metaphysical interpretations indeed from antiquity until well into the modern age a physics devoid of metaphysical insight would have been as unsatisfying as a metaphysics devoid of physical manifestation for one thing the lack of common words for chemical concepts and processes as well as the need for secrecy led alchemists to borrow the terms and symbols of biblical and pagan mythology astrology kabbalah and other mystic and esoteric fields so that even the plainest chemical recipe ended up reading like an abstruse magic incantation moreover alchemists sought in those fields the theoretical frameworks into which they could fit their growing collection of disjointed experimental facts starting with the middle ages some alchemists increasingly came to view these metaphysical aspects as the true foundation of alchemy and chemical substances physical states and material processes as mere metaphors for spiritual entities states and transformations thus both the transmutation of common metals into gold and the universal panacea symbolized evolution from an imperfect diseased corruptible and ephemeral state towards a perfect healthy incorruptible and everlasting state and the philosopher s stone then represented some mystic key that would make this evolution possible applied to the alchemist himself the twin goal symbolized his evolution from ignorance to enlightenment and the stone represented some hidden spiritual truth or power that would lead to that goal in texts that are written according to this view the cryptic alchemical symbols diagrams and textual imagery of late alchemical works typically contain multiple layers of meanings allegories and references to other equally cryptic works and must be laborously decoded in order to discover their true meaning some humanistic scholars now see these spiritual and metaphysical allegories as the truest and most valuable aspect of alchemy and even claim that the development of chemistry out of alchemy was a corruption of the original hermetic tradition this is the view espoused by contemporary practitioners of spiritual alchemy most scientists on the other hand tend to take quite the opposite view to them the path from the material side of alchemy to modern chemistry was the straight road in the evolution of the discipline while the metaphysically oriented brand of alchemy was a wrong turn that led to nowhere in either view however the na ve interpretations of some practitoners or the fraudulent hopes fostered by others should not diminish the contribution of the more sincere alchemists alchemy and astrology since its earliest times alchemy has been closely connected to astrology which in islam and europe generally meant the traditional babylonian greek school of astrology alchemical systems often postulated that each of the seven planets known to the ancients ruled or was associated with a certain metal see the separate article on astrology and alchemy for further details alchemy in the age of science up to the one eight th century alchemy was actually considered serious science in europe for instance isaac newton devoted considerably more of his time and writing to the study of alchemy than he did to either optics or physics for which he is famous see isaac newton s occult studies other eminent alchemists of the western world are roger bacon saint thomas aquinas tycho brahe thomas browne and parmigianino the decline of alchemy began in the one eight th century with the birth of modern chemistry which provided a more precise and reliable framework for matter transmutations and medicine within a new grand design of the universe based on rational materialism in the first half of the nineteenth century one established chemist baron carl reichenbach researched on concepts similar to the old alchemy such as the odic force but his research did not enter the mainstream of scientific discussion matter transmutation the old goal of alchemy enjoyed a moment in the sun in the two zero th century when physicists were able to convert lead atoms into gold atoms via a nuclear reaction however the new gold atoms being unstable isotopes lasted for under five seconds before they broke apart more recently reports of table top element transmutation by means of electrolysis or sonic cavitation were the pivot of the cold fusion controversy of one nine eight nine none of those claims have yet been reliably duplicated alchemical symbolism has been occasionally used in the two zero th century by psychologists and philosophers carl jung reexamined alchemical symbolism and theory and began to show the inner meaning of alchemical work as a spiritual path alchemical philosophy symbols and methods have enjoyed something of a renaissance in post modern contexts such as the new age movement even some physicists have played with alchemical ideas in books such as the tao of physics and the dancing wu li masters alchemy as a subject of historical research the history of alchemy has become a vigorous academic field as the obscure hermetic of course language of the alchemists is gradually being deciphered historians are becoming more aware of the intellectual connections between that discipline and other facets of western cultural history such as the sociology and psychology of the intellectual communities kabbalism spiritualism rosicrucianism and other mystic movements cryptography witchcraft and of course the evolution of science and philosophy etymology the word alchemy comes from the arabic al k miya or al kh miya or which might be formed from the article al and the greek word chumeia meaning cast together pour together weld alloy etc from khumatos that which is poured out an ingot or from persian kimia meaning gold a decree of diocletian written about three zero zero ce in greek speaks against the ancient writings of the egyptians which treat of the kh mia transmutation of gold and silver it has been suggested that the arabic word al k miya actually means the egyptian science borrowing from the coptic word for egypt k me or its equivalent in the mediaeval bohairic dialect of coptic kh me the coptic word derives from demotic km itself from ancient egyptian kmt the ancient egyptian word referred to both the country and the colour black egypt was the black land by contrast with the red land the surrounding desert so this etymology could also explain the nickname egyptian black arts however this theory may be just an example of folk etymology history extract and symbol key from a one seven th century book on alchemy the symbols used have a one to one correspondence with symbols used in astrology at the time alchemy encompasses several philosophical traditions spanning some four millennia and three continents these traditions general penchant for cryptic and symbolic language makes it hard to trace their mutual influences and genetic relationships one can distinguish at least two major strands which appear to be largely independent at least in their earlier stages chinese alchemy centered in china and its zone of cultural influence and western alchemy whose center has shifted over the millennia between egypt greece and rome the islamic world and finally back to europe chinese alchemy was closely connected to taoism whereas western alchemy developed its own philosophical system with only superficial connections to the major western religions it is still an open question whether these two strands share a common origin or to what extent they influenced each other alchemy in ancient egypt the origin of western alchemy may generally be traced to ancient pharaonic egypt metallurgy and mysticism were inexorably tied together in the ancient world as the transformation of drab ore into shining metal must have seemed to be an act of magic governed by mysterious rules it is claimed therefore that alchemy in ancient egypt was the domain of the priestly class egyptian alchemy is known mostly through the writings of ancient hellenic greek philosophers which in turn have often survived only in islamic translations practically no original egyptian documents on alchemy have survived those writings if they existed were likely lost when the emperor diocletian ordered the burning of alchemical books after suppressing a revolt in alexandria two nine two which had been a center of egyptian alchemy nevertheless archaeological expeditions in recent times have unearthed evidence of chemical analysis during the naqada periods for example a copper tool dating to the naqada era bears evidence of having been used in such a way reference artifact five four three seven on display at also the process of tanning animal skins was already known in predynastic egypt as early as the six th millennium bc although it possibly was discovered haphazardly other evidence indicates early alchemists in ancient egypt had invented mortar by four zero zero zero bc and glass by one five zero zero bc the chemical reaction involved in the production of calcium oxide is one of the oldest known references calcium oxide limekiln caco three heat cao co two ancient egypt additionally produced cosmetics cement faience and also pitch for shipbuilding papyrus had also been invented by three zero zero zero bc legend has it that the founder of egyptian alchemy was the god thoth called hermes thoth or thrice great hermes hermes trismegistus by the greek according to legend he wrote what were called the forty two books of knowledge covering all fields of knowledge including alchemy hermes s symbol was the caduceus or serpent staff which became one of many of alchemy s principal symbols the emerald tablet or hermetica of thrice great hermes which is known only through greek and arabic translations is generally understood to form the basis for western alchemical philosophy and practice called the hermetic philosophy by its early practitioners the first point of the emerald tablet tells the purpose of hermetical science in truth certainly and without doubt whatever is below is like that which is above and whatever is above is like that which is below to accomplish the miracles of one thing this is the macrocosm microcosm belief central to the hermetic philosophy in other words the human body the microcosm is affected by the exterior world the macrocosm which includes the heavens through astrology and the earth through the elements it has been speculated that a riddle from the emerald tablet it was carried in the womb by the wind refers to the distillation of oxygen from saltpeter a process that was unknown in europe until its re discovery by sendivogius in the one seven th century in the four th century bc the greek speaking macedonians conquered egypt and founded the city of alexandria in three three two this brought them into contact with egyptian ideas see alchemy in the greek world below chinese alchemy whereas western alchemy eventually centered on the transmutation of base metals into noble ones chinese alchemy had a more obvious connection to medicine the philosopher s stone of european alchemists can be compared to the grand elixir of immortality sought by chinese alchemists however in the hermetic view these two goals were not unconnected and the philosopher s stone was often equated with the universal panacea therefore the two traditions may have had more in common than it initially appears black powder may have been an important invention of chinese alchemists described in nine th century texts and used in fireworks by the one zero th century it was used in cannons by one two nine zero from china the use of gunpowder spread to japan the mongols the arab world and europe gunpowder was used by the mongols against the hungarians in one two four one and in europe starting with the one four th century black powder was most likely invented in the middle east before it found its way to china saltpeter the critical oxidising component was found naturally in india and along the salt trade routes in the middle east chinese alchemy was closely connected to taoist forms of medicine such as acupuncture and moxibustion and to martial arts such as tai chi chuan and kung fu although some tai chi schools believe that their art derives from the hygienic or philosophical branches of taoism not the alchemical indian alchemy little is known in the west about the character and history of indian alchemy an one one th century persian alchemist named al biruni reported that they have a science similar to alchemy which is quite peculiar to them which is called rasav tam it means the art which is restricted to certain operations drugs compounds and medicines most of which are taken from plants its principles restored the health of those who were ill beyond hope and gave back youth to fading old age the best example of a text based on this science is the vaishashik darshana of kanada fl six zero zero bc who described an atomic theory over a century before democritus the texts of ayurvedic medicine and science have aspects related to alchemy such having cures for all known diseases the similarities in ayurveda and alchemy are that both had methods used to treat people by putting oils over them some people have also noted certain similarities between the metaphysics of the samkhya philosophical tradition of hinduism and the metaphysics of alchemy whether there is any direct connection between the two systems is an open question the rasavadam was understood by very few people at the time two famous examples were nagarjunacharya and nityanadhiya nagarjunacharya was a buddhist monk who in ancient times ran the great university of nagarjuna sagar his famous book rasaratanakaram is a famous example of early indian medicine in traditional indian medicinal terminology rasa translates as mercury and nagarjunacharya was said to have developed a method to convert the mercury into gold much of his original writings are lost to us but his teachings still have strong influence on traditional indian medicine ayureveda to this day alchemy in the greek world the greek city of alexandria in egypt was a center of greek alchemical knowledge and retained its preeminence through most of the greek and roman periods the greeks appropriated the hermetical beliefs of the egyptians and melded with them the philosophies of pythagoreanism ionianism and gnosticism pythagorean philosophy is essentially the belief that numbers rule the universe originating from the observations of sound stars and geometric shapes like triangles or anything from which a ratio could be derived ionian thought was based on the belief that the universe could be explained through concentration on natural phenomena this philosophy is believed to have originated with thales and his pupil anaximander and later developed by plato and aristotle whose works came to be an integral part of alchemy according to this belief the universe can be described by a few unified natural laws that can be determined only through careful thorough and exacting philosophical explorations the third component introduced to hermetical philosophy by the greeks was gnosticism a belief prevalent in the christian and early post christian roman empire that the world is imperfect because it was created in a flawed manner and that learning about the nature of spiritual matter would lead to salvation they further believed that god did not create the universe in the classic sense but that the universe was created from him but was corrupted in the process rather than becoming corrupted by the transgressions of adam and eve i e original sin according to gnostic belief by worshipping the cosmos nature or the creatures of the world one worships the true god gnostics do not seek salvation from sin but instead seek to escape ignorance believing that sin is merely a consequence of ignorance platonic and neo platonic theories about universals and the omnipotence of god were also absorbed one very important concept introduced at this time originated by empedocles and developed by aristotle was that all things in the universe were formed from only four elements earth air water and fire according to aristotle each element had a sphere to which it belonged and to which it would return if left undisturbed the four elements of the greek were mostly qualitative aspects of matter not quantitative as our modern elements are true alchemy never regarded earth air water and fire as corporeal or chemical substances in the present day sense of the word the four elements are simply the primary and most general qualities by means of which the amorphous and purely quantitative substance of all bodies first reveals itself in differentiated form later alchemists if plato and aristotle can be called alchemists extensively developed the mystical aspects of this concept alchemy in the roman empire the romans adopted greek alchemy and metaphysics just as they adopted much of greek knowledge and philosophy by the end of the roman empire the greek alchemical philosophy had been joined to the philosophies of the egyptians to create the cult of hermeticism however the development of christianity in the empire brought a contrary line of thinking stemming from augustine three five four four three zero ad an early christian philosopher who wrote of his beliefs shortly before the fall of the roman empire in essence he felt that reason and faith could be used to understand god but experimental philosophy was evil there is also present in the soul by means of these same bodily sense a kind of empty longing and curiosity which aims not at taking pleasure in the flesh but at acquiring experience through the flesh and this empty curiosity he is dignified by the names of learning and science augustinian ideas were decidedly anti experimental yet when aristotelian experimental techniques were made available to the west they were not shunned still augustinian thought was well ingrained in medieval society and was used to show alchemy as being un godly much of the roman knowledge of alchemy like that of the greeks and egyptians is now lost in alexandria the centre of alchemical studies in the roman empire the art was mainly oral and in the interests of secrecy little was committed to paper whence the use of hermetic to mean secretive it is possible that some writing was done in alexandria and that it was subsequently lost or destroyed in fires and the turbulent periods that followed alchemy in the islamic world after the fall of the roman empire the focus of alchemical development moved to the middle east much more is known about islamic alchemy because it was better documented indeed most of the earlier writings that have come down through the years were preserved as islamic translations the islamic world was a melting pot for alchemy platonic and aristotelian thought which had already been somewhat appropriated into hermetical science continued to be assimilated islamic alchemists such as al razi latin rasis or rhazes contributed key chemical discoveries of their own such as the technique of distillation the words alembic and alcohol are of arabic origin the muriatic sulfuric and nitric acids soda potash and more from the arabic names of the last two substances al natrun and al qal y latinized into natrium and kalium come the modern symbols for sodium and potassium the discovery that aqua regia a mixture of nitric and muriatic acids could dissolve the noblest metal gold was to fuel the imagination of alchemists for the next millennium islamic philosophers also made great contributions to alchemical hermeticism the most influential author in this regard was arguably jabir ibn hayyan arabic latin geberus usually rendered in english as geber jabir s ultimate goal was takwin the artificial creation of life in the alchemical laboratory up to and including human life he analyzed each aristotelian element in terms of four basic qualities of hotness coldness dryness and moistness according to geber in each metal two of these qualities were interior and two were exterior for example lead was externally cold and dry while gold was hot and moist thus jabir theorized by rearranging the qualities of one metal a different metal would result by this reasoning the search for the philosopher s stone was introduced to western alchemy jabir developed an elaborate numerology whereby the root letters of a substance s name in arabic when treated with various transformations held correspondences to the element s physical properties it is now commonly accepted that chinese alchemy influenced arabic alchemists although the extent of that influence is still a matter of debate likewise hindu learning was assimilated into islamic alchemy but again the extent and effects of this are not well known alchemy in medieval europe the alchemist in search of the philosophers stone by joseph wright of derby one seven seven one because of its strong connections to the greek and roman cultures alchemy was rather easily accepted into christian philosophy and medieval european alchemists extensively absorbed islamic alchemical knowledge gerbert of aurillac who was later to become pope silvester ii d one zero zero three was among the first to bring islamic science to europe from spain later men such as adelard of bath who lived in the one two th century brought additional learning but until the one three th century the moves were mainly assimilative in this period there appeared some deviations from the augustinian principles of earlier christian thinkers saint anselm one zero three three one one zero nine was a benedictine who believed faith must precede rationalism as augustine and most theologians prior to anselm had believed but anselm put forth the opinion that faith and rationalism were compatible and encouraged rationalism in a christian context his views set the stage for the philosophical explosion to occur peter abelard followed anselm s work laying the foundation for acceptance of aristotelian thought before the first works of aristotle reached the west his major influence on alchemy was his belief that platonic universals did not have a separate existence outside of man s consciousness abelard also systematized the analysis of philosophical contradictions robert grosseteste one one seven zero one two five three was a pioneer of the scientific theory that would later be used and refined by the alchemists he took abelard s methods of analysis and added the use of observations experimentation and conclusions in making scientific evaluations grosseteste also did much work to bridge platonic and aristotelian thinking albertus magnus one one nine three one two eight zero and thomas aquinas one two two five one two seven four were both dominicans who studied aristotle and worked at reconciling the differences between philosophy and christianity aquinas also did a great deal of work in developing the scientific method he even went as far as claiming that universals could be discovered only through logical reasoning and since reason could not run in opposition to god reason must be compatible with theology this ran contrary to the commonly held platonic belief that universals were found through divine illumination alone magnus and aquinas were among the first to take up the examination of alchemical theory and could be considered to be alchemists themselves except that these two did little in the way of experimentation the first true alchemist in medieval europe was roger bacon his work did as much for alchemy as robert boyle s was to do for chemistry and galileo s for astronomy and physics bacon one two one four one two nine four was an oxford franciscan who explored optics and languages in addition to alchemy the franciscan ideals of taking on the world rather than rejecting the world led to his conviction that experimentation was more important than reasoning of the three ways in which men think that they acquire knowledge of things authority reasoning and experience only the last is effective and able to bring peace to the intellect bacon p three six seven experimental science controls the conclusions of all other sciences it reveals truths which reasoning from general principles would never have discovered roger bacon has also been attributed with originating the search for the philosopher s stone and the elixir of life that medicine which will remove all impurities and corruptibilities from the lesser metals will also in the opinion of the wise take off so much of the corruptibility of the body that human life may be prolonged for many centuries the idea of immortality was replaced with the notion of long life after all man s time on earth was simply to wait and prepare for immortality in the world of god immortality on earth did not mesh with christian theology bacon was not the only alchemist of the high middle ages but he was the most significant his works were used by countless alchemists of the fifteenth through nineteenth centuries other alchemists of bacon s time shared several traits first and most obviously nearly all were members of the clergy this was simply because few people outside the parochial schools had the education to examine the arabic derived works also alchemy at this time was sanctioned by the church as a good method of exploring and developing theology alchemy was interesting to the wide variety of churchmen because it offered a rationalistic view of the universe when men were just beginning to learn about rationalism so by the end of the thirteenth century alchemy had developed into a fairly structured system of belief adepts believed in the macrocosm microcosm theories of hermes that is to say they believed that processes that affect minerals and other substances could have an effect on the human body e g if one could learn the secret of purifying gold one could use the technique to purify the human soul they believed in the four elements and the four qualities as described above and they had a strong tradition of cloaking their written ideas in a labyrinth of coded jargon set with traps to mislead the uninitiated finally the alchemists practiced their art they actively experimented with chemicals and made observations and theories about how the universe operated their entire philosophy revolved around their belief that man s soul was divided within himself after the fall of adam by purifying the two parts of man s soul man could be reunited with god in the fourteenth century these views underwent a major change william of ockham an oxford franciscan who died in one three four nine attacked the thomist view of compatibility between faith and reason his view widely accepted today was that god must be accepted on faith alone he could not be limited by human reason of course this view was not incorrect if one accepted the postulate of a limitless god versus limited human reasoning capability but it virtually erased alchemy from practice in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries pope john xxii in the early one three zero zero s issued an edict against alchemy which effectively removed all church personnel from the practice of the art the climate changes black plague and increase in warfare and famine that characterized this century no doubt also served to hamper philosophical pursuits in general nicholas flamel had these mysterious alchemical symbols carved on his tomb in the church of the holy innocents in paris alchemy was kept alive by men such as nicolas flamel who was noteworthy only because he was one of the few alchemists writing in those troubled times flamel lived from one three three zero to one four one seven and would serve as the archetype for the next phase of alchemy he was not a religious scholar as were many of his predecessors and his entire interest in the subject revolved around the pursuit of the philosopher s stone which he is reputed to have found his work spends a great deal of time describing the processes and reactions but never actually gives the formula for carrying out the transmutations most of his work was aimed at gathering alchemical knowledge that had existed before him especially as regarded the philosophers stone through the high middle ages one three zero zero one five zero zero alchemists were much like flamel they concentrated on looking for the philosophers stone and the elixir of youth now believed to be separate things their cryptic allusions and symbolism led to wide variations in interpretation of the art for example many alchemists during this period interpreted the purification of the soul to mean the transmutation of lead into gold in which they believed elemental mercury or quicksilver played a crucial role these men were viewed as magicians and sorcerers by many and were often persecuted for their practices one of these men who emerged at the beginning of the sixteenth century was named heinrich cornelius agrippa this alchemist believed himself to be a wizard and actually thought himself capable of summoning spirits his influence was negligible but like flamel he produced writings which were referred to by alchemists of later years again like flamel he did much to change alchemy from a mystical philosophy to an occultist magic he did keep alive the philosophies of the earlier alchemists including experimental science numerology etc but he added magic theory which reinforced the idea of alchemy as an occultist belief in spite of all this agrippa still considered himself a christian though his views often came into conflict with the church alchemy in the modern age and renaissance european alchemy continued in this way through the dawning of the renaissance the era also saw a flourishing of con artists who would use chemical tricks and sleight of hand to demonstrate the transmutation of common metals into gold or claim to possess secret knowledge that with a small initial investment would surely lead to that goal the most important name in this period is philippus aureolus paracelsus theophrastus bombastus von hohenheim one four nine three one five four one who cast alchemy into a new form rejecting some of the occultism that had accumulated over the years and promoting the use of observations and experiments to learn about the human body he rejected gnostic traditions but kept much of the hermetical neo platonic and pythagorean philosophies however hermetical science had so much aristotelian theory that his rejection of gnosticism was practically meaningless in particular paracelsus rejected the magic theories of agrippa and flamel he did not think of himself as a magician and scorned those who did williams p two three nine four five paracelsus pioneered the use of chemicals and minerals in medicine and wrote many have said of alchemy that it is for the making of gold and silver for me such is not the aim but to consider only what virtue and power may lie in medicines his hermetical views were that sickness and health in the body relied on the harmony of man the microcosm and nature the macrocosm he took an approach different from those before him using this analogy not in the manner of soul purification but in the manner that humans must have certain balances of minerals in their bodies and that certain illnesses of the body had chemical remedies that could cure them while his attempts of treating diseases with such remedies as mercury might seem ill advised from a modern point of view his basic idea of chemically produced medicines has stood time surprisingly well alchemik micha s dziw j oil on board by jan matejko seven three x one three zero cm museum of arts in d in england the topic of alchemy in that time frame is often associated with doctor john dee one three july one five two seven december one six zero eight better known for his role as astrologer cryptographer and general scientific consultant to queen elizabeth i dee was considered an authority on the works of roger bacon and was interested enough in alchemy to write a book on that subject monas hieroglyphica one five six four influenced by the kabbala dee s associate edward kelley who claimed to converse with angels through a crystal ball and to own a powder that would turn mercury into gold may have been the source of the popular image of the alchemist charlatan another lesser known alchemist was michael sendivogius micha s dziw j one five six six one six three six a polish alchemist philosopher medical doctor and pioneer of chemistry according to some accounts he distilled oxygen in a lab sometime around one six zero zero one seven zero years before scheele and priestley by warming nitre saltpetre he thought of the gas given off as the elixir of life shortly after discovering this method it is believed that sendivogious taught his technique to cornelius drebbel in one six two one drebbel practically applied this in a submarine tycho brahe one five four six one six zero one better known for his astronomical and astrological investigations was also an alchemist he had a laboratory built for that purpose at his uraniborg observatory research institute the decline of western alchemy the demise of western alchemy was brought about by the rise of modern science with its emphasis on rigorous quantitative experimentation and its disdain for ancient wisdom although the seeds of these events were planted as early as the one seven th century alchemy still flourished for some two hundred years and in fact may have reached its apogee in the one eight th century robert boyle one six two seven one six nine one better known for his studies of gases cf boyle s law pioneered the scientific method in chemical investigations he assumed nothing in his experiments and compiled every piece of relevant data in a typical experiment boyle would note the place in which the experiment was carried out the wind characteristics the position of the sun and moon and the barometer reading all just in case they proved to be relevant this approach eventually led to the founding of modern chemistry in the one eight th and one nine th centuries based on revolutionary discoveries of lavoisier and john dalton which finally provided a logical quantitative and reliable framework for understanding matter transmutations and revealed the futility of longstanding alchemical goals such as the philospher s

eventually traced many diseases to infections with germs koch and pasteur one nine th century or lack of natural nutrients and vitamins lind eijkman funk et al supported by parallel developments in organic chemistry the new science easily displaced alchemy from its medical roles interpretive and prescriptive while deflating its hopes of miraculous elixirs and exposing the ineffectiveness or even toxicity of its remedies thus as science steadily continued to uncover and rationalize the clockwork of the universe founded on its own materialistic metaphysics alchemy was left deprived of its chemical and medical connections but still incurably burdened by them reduced to an arcane philosophical system poorly connected to the material world it suffered the common fate of other esoteric disciplines such as astrology and kabbalah excluded from university curricula shunned by its former patrons ostracized by scientists and commonly viewed as the epitome of charlatanism and superstition these developments could be interpreted as part of a broader reaction in european intellectualism against the romantic movement of the preceding century be as it may it is sobering to observe how a discipline that held so much intellectual and material prestige for more than two thousand years could disappear so easily from the universe of western thought modern alchemy in modern times progress has been made toward achieving the goals of alchemy using scientific rather than alchemic means these developments may on occasion be called alchemy for rhetorical reasons in one nine one nine ernest

as ray kurzweil believe sufficiently advanced nanotechnology may prolong life indefinitely some say the third goal of alchemy has been fulfilled by ivf and the cloning of a human embryo although these

broadcast also called ads b is a system by which airplanes constantly broadcast their current position and altitude category of aircraft airspeed identification and whether the aircraft is turning climbing or descending over a dedicated radio datalink this functionality is known as ads b out and is the basic level of ads b functionality the ads b system was developed in the one nine nine zero s it relies on data from the global positioning system or any navigation system that provides an equivalent or better service the maximum range of the system is line of sight typically less than two zero zero nautical miles three seven zero km the ads b transmissions are received by air traffic control stations and all other ads b equipped aircraft within reception range reception by aircraft of ads b data is known as ads b in usage the initial use of ads b is expected to be by air traffic control and for surveillance purposes and for enhancing pilot situational awareness ads b is lower cost than conventional radar and permits higher quality surveillance of airborne and surface movements ads b is effective in remote areas or in mountainous terrain where there is no radar coverage or where radar coverage is limited the outback of australia is one such area where ads b will provide surveillance where previously none existed ads b also enhances surveillance on the airport surface so it can also be used to monitor traffic on the taxiways and runways of an airport ads b equipped aircraft may also have a display unit in the cockpit picturing surrounding air traffic from ads b data ads b in and tis b traffic information service broadcast data derived from air traffic radar both pilots and air traffic controllers will then be able to see the positions of air traffic in the vicinity of the aircraft and this may be used to provide an asas airborne separation assurance system airborne collision avoidance systems may in the future also make use of ads b in supplementing the existing tcas collision avoidance system by what is called hybrid surveillance airbus and boeing are now expected to include ads b out i e the transmitter of information as standard on new build aircraft from two zero zero five onwards this is in part due to the european requirements for mode s elementary surveillance which uses one zero nine zero mhz mode s transponder which now is normally capable of ads b via extended squitter and some common functionality with ads b out addressed and broadcast ads the radio technical commission for aeronautics rtca free flight selection committee defines surveillance as detection tracking characterization and observation of aircraft other vehicles and weather phenomena for the purpose of conducting flight operations in a safe and efficient manner automatic dependent surveillance ads is described as the process of creating and sending a message including the sender s current position and other surveillance information such as velocity intent and flight identification this information supports aircraft separation management by improving surveillance information at increased ranges situational awareness and decision making ads data can be used in cooperation with data from current radar beacon systems such as air traffic control radar beacon systems atcrbs mode s traffic collision avoidance systems tcas and primary air traffic control atc radar and may also be used as a sole means of surveillance there are two commonly recognized types of ads for aircraft applications ads addressed ads a also known as ads contract ads c and ads broadcast ads b ads a provides a surveillance data report that is sent to a specific addressee for example ads a reports are employed in the future air navigation system fans using the aircraft communication addressing and reporting system acars as the communication protocol during transoceanic flight reports are periodically sent by an aircraft to the controlling air traffic region when ads b is used aircraft and other vehicles continuously broadcast a message including position heading velocity and intent other uses may include obstacles transmitting a position message aircraft ground based stations and other users monitoring the channels can receive the information and use it in a wide variety of applications because of this potential for broad utilization a system using ads b is most often discussed as a replacement for or an augmentation to current methods of monitoring aeronautical traffic to understand the full capability of ads b consider how the current air traffic control system creates information the radar measures the range and bearing of an aircraft bearing is measured by the position of the rotating radar antenna when it receives a response to its interrogation from the aircraft and range is measured by the time it takes for the radar to receive the interrogation response the antenna beam becomes wider as the aircraft get farther away making the position information less accurate additionally detecting changes in aircraft velocity requires several radar sweeps that are spaced several seconds apart in contrast a system using ads b creates and listens for periodic position and intent reports from aircraft these reports are generated and distributed using precise instruments such as the global positioning system gps and mode s transponders meaning integrity of the data is no longer susceptible to the range of the aircraft or the length of time between radar sweeps the enhanced accuracy of the information will be used to improve safety support a wide variety of applications and increase airport and airspace capacity use of ads b for ground based surveillance requires only ads b out transmit capability on the aircraft with the addition of ads b in receive capability the potential for ads b applications grows significantly some of the equipment and services associated with ads b in capability include cockpit display of traffic information cdti a display of proximate traffic based on ads b reports from other aircraft and ground based facilities traffic information services broadcast tis b a ground based uplink report of proximate traffic that is under surveillance by atc but is not ads b equipped this service would be available even with limited ads b implementation flight information services broadcast fis b a ground based uplink of flight information services and weather data ads b physical layer three link solutions are being proposed as the physical layer for relaying the ads b position reports one zero nine zero mhz mode s extended squitter es universal access transceiver uat and vhf digital link vdl mode four mode s the faa has announced its selection of the one zero nine zero mhz es and uat as the mediums for the ads b system in the united states one zero nine zero mhz es will be the primary medium for air carrier and high performance commercial aircraft while uat will be the primary medium for general aviation aircraft europe has also chosen one zero nine zero mhz as the primary physical layer for ads b however the second medium has not yet been selected between uat and vdl mode four with one zero nine zero es the existing mode s transponder or a stand alone one zero nine zero mhz transmitter supports a message type known as the es message it is a periodic message that provides position velocity heading time and in the future intent the basic es does not offer intent since current flight management systems do not provide such data called trajectory change points to enable an aircraft to send an extended squitter message the transponder is modified and aircraft position and other status information is routed to the transponder atc ground stations and tcas equipped aircraft already have the necessary one zero nine zero mhz receivers to receive these signals and would only require enhancements to accept and process the additional information one zero nine zero es will not support fis b due to regulatory requirements universal access transceiver the uat system is specifically designed for ads b operation a one mhz channel in the nine zero zero mhz frequency range is dedicated for transmission of airborne ads b reports and for broadcast of ground based aeronautical information uat users would have access to the additional ground based aeronautical data and would receive reports from proximate traffic fis b and tis b vdl mode four the vdl mode four system could utilize one or more of the existing aeronautical vhf frequencies as the radio frequency physical layer for ads b transmissions vdl mode four uses a protocol stdma that allows it to be self organizing meaning no master ground station is required this medium is best used for short message transmissions from a large number of users vdl mode four systems are capable of increased range in comparison to l band mode s one zero nine zero mhz or uat systems implementation timetable the timetable for airborne ads b equipage will be determined by ground and airborne facility implementation equipment cost perceived benefits of equipping and regulatory actions by the civil aviation authorities caa the cost to equip with ads b out capability is relatively small and would benefit the airspace by enabling increased situational awareness ads b in capability can provide additional benefits when ground stations and the critical mass of aircraft are also equipped this data was taken into consideration when building the following estimated implementation timetable near term implementation two zero zero six two zero zero eight the next three years will see a continuation of ads b trials and some implementation in pockets where limited aircraft equipage can bring operational benefits some of these include capstone in alaska the faa is conducting its capstone program to improve surveillance in some of the more remote locations of alaska and as a test bed for implementing elements of ads b into the atc environment approximately one nine zero general aviation users have been equipped with gps receivers uat transceivers and flight deck displays in addition one one ground based transceivers have been installed for radar like services and flight information services data fis b including weather information is being uplinked from the ground phase ii of the program will expand the coverage and add more than two five zero additional users gulf of mexico in the gulf of mexico where atc radar coverage is incomplete the faa is locating ads b one zero nine zero mhz receivers on oil rigs and buoys to relay information received from aircraft equipped with ads b extended squitters back to the atc centers to expand and improve surveillance coverage australia australia is implementing ads b trials in queensland to test the feasibility of one zero nine zero mhz ads b as an alternative to ground based radar ads b is expected to be a much more cost effective method of providing atc surveillance coverage for remote areas which currently have limited or no surveillance coverage cargo airline association cargo carriers operating at their hub airports operate largely at night equipage of these aircraft with ads b and cdti displays along with a ground based transceiver at these hubs will allow better situational awareness at night and in inclement weather and offers the potential for increased airport traffic handling capability embry riddle aeronautical university embry riddle aeronautical university is equipping the training aircraft at its two main campuses in florida and arizona with ads b capability as a safety enhancement the faa will provide fis b and tis b uplink capabilities in those areas in support of this equipage safe flight two one east coast broadcast services the faa has announced its intention to implement ads b coverage for the entire east coast of the u s by the end of two zero zero four service

fis b information mid term implementation two zero zero eight two zero one two within four to eight years an increasing number of aircraft with ads b out capability along with the start of ground based ads b infrastructure will begin to make a number of ads b applications attractive benefits of pockets of implementation will become evident and these areas will be expanded encouraging more users to equip with ads b capability beginning in two zero zero four the faa is expected to deploy ads b ground infrastructure based on asde x equipment this infrastructure will allow the use of ads b data for atc purposes such as surface movement tracking guidance and airborne surveillance ground uplinks of tis b and fis b will commence where the ground infrastructure is deployed other civil aviation authorities may install ads b ground infrastructure and require aircraft to be equipped with ads b out for operation in selected airspace australia is expected to be the first country to do so however a number of other countries with limited surveillance coverage may find ads b an attractive alternative to radar surveillance significant numbers of users will become equipped with a minimum of ads b out capability in europe one zero nine zero mhz es will become standard capability for all new mode s transponder installations after three one march two zero zero five uat will

west the capital is the city of vienna austria is a parliamentary representative democracy consisting of nine federal states and is one of two european countries that have declared their everlasting neutrality the other being switzerland austria is a member of the united nations since one nine five five and the european union since one nine nine five for the first half of two zero zero six austria holds the seat of the presidency of the eu origin and history of the name the german name sterreich can be translated into english as the eastern realm which is derived from the old german ostarr chi reich can also mean empire and this connotation is the one that is understood in the context of the austrian austro hungarian empire holy roman empire although not in the context of the modern republic of sterreich the term probably originates in a vernacular translation of the medieval latin name for the region marchia orientalis which translates as eastern border as it was situated at the eastern edge of the holy roman empire that was also mirrored in the name ostmark applied after anschluss to germany history austria and the holy roman empire the territory of austria originally known as the celtic kingdom of noricum was a long time ally of rome it was occupied rather than conquered by the romans during the reign of augustus and made the province noricum in one six bc later it was conquered by huns rugii lombards ostrogoths bavarii avars until c eight zero zero and franks in that order finally after four eight years of hungarian rule nine zero seven to nine five five the core territory of austria was awarded to leopold of babenberg in nine seven six being part of the holy roman empire the babenbergs ruled and expanded austria from the one zero th century to the one three th century battle of vienna one six eight three after duke frederick ii died in one two four six and left no successor rudolf i of habsburg gave the lands to his sons marking the beginning of the line of the habsburgs who continued to govern austria until the two zero th century with the short exception of charles vii albert of bavaria austrian habsburgs held the position of german emperor beginning in one four three eight with albert ii of habsburg until the end of the holy roman empire during the one four th and one five th century austria continued to expand its territory until it reached the position of a european imperial power at the end of the one five th century until the end of the habsburg monarchy in one nine one eight modern history just two years before the abolition of the holy roman empire in one eight zero six in one eight zero four the empire of austria was founded which was transformed in one eight six seven into the dual monarchy austria hungary the empire was split into several independent states in one nine one eight after the defeat of the central powers in world war i with most of the german speaking parts becoming a republic see treaty of saint germain between one nine one eight and one nine one nine it was officially known as the republic of german austria republik deutsch sterreich after the entente powers forbade german austria to unite with germany they also forbade the name and then it was changed to simply republic of austria the democratic republic lasted until one nine three three when the chancellor engelbert dollfu established an autocratic regime oriented towards italian fascism austrofascism austria became part of germany in one nine three eight through the anschlu and remained under nazi rule until the end of world war ii after the defeat of the axis powers the allies occupied austria until one nine five five when the country became a fully independent republic under the condition that it would remain neutral see austrian state treaty austria also became a member of the un in the same year after the collapse of communist states in eastern europe austria became increasingly involved in european affairs and in one nine nine five austria joined the european union and the euro monetary system in one nine nine nine politics austrian parliament in vienna austria became a federal parliamentarian democratic republic through the federal constitution of one nine two zero it was reintroduced in one nine four five to the nine states of the federal republic the head of state is the federal president who is directly elected the chairman of the federal government is the federal chancellor who is appointed by the president the government can be removed from office by either a presidential decree or by vote of no confidence in the lower chamber of parliament the nationalrat the parliament of austria consists of two chambers the composition of the nationalrat is determined every four years by a free general election in which every citizen is allowed to vote to fill its one eight three seats a four percent hurdle prevents a large splintering of the political landscape in the nationalrat by awarding seats only to political parties that have obtained at least a four percent threshold of the general vote or alternatively have won a direct seat or direktmandat in one of the four three regional election districts the nationalrat is the dominant chamber in the formation of legislation in austria however the upper house of parliament the bundesrat has a limited right of veto the nationalrat can in most cases pass the respective bill a second time bypassing the bundesrat altogether a convention called the sterreich konvent was convened in june three zero two zero zero three to decide upon suggestions to reform the constitution but has failed to produce a proposal that would receive the two thirds of votes in the nationalrat necessary for constitutional amendments and or reform however some important parts of the final report were generally agreed upon and are still expected to be implemented subdivisions a federal republic austria is divided into nine states german bundesl nder these states are divided into districts bezirke and cities statutarst dte districts are subdivided into municipalities gemeinden cities have the competencies otherwise granted to both districts and municipalities the states are not mere administrative divisions but have some distinct legislative authority separate from the federal government states of austria geography topography of austria austria is a largely mountainous country due to its location in the alps the central eastern alps northern limestone alps and southern limestone alps are all partly in austria of the total area of austria eight four zero zero zero km or three two zero zero zero sq mi only about a quarter can be considered low lying and only three two of the country is below five zero zero metres one six four zero ft the high mountainous alps in the west of austria flatten somewhat into low lands and plains in the east of the country map of austria austria may be divided into five different areas the biggest area are the austrian alps which constitute six two of austria s total area the austrian foothills at the base of the alps and the carpathians account for around one two of its area the foothills in the east and areas surrounding the periphery of the pannoni low country amount to about one two of the total landmass the second greater mountain area much lower than the alps is situated in the north known as the austrian granite plateau it is located in the central area of the bohemian mass and accounts for one zero of austria the austrian portion of the viennese basin comprises the remaining four climate the greater part of austria lies in the cool temperate climate zone in which humid westerly winds predominate with over half of the country dominated by the alps the alpine climate is the predominant one in the east the climate shows continental features with less rain than the areas with high rainfall averages the six highest mountains in austria are economy the belvedere palace an example of the baroque austria has a well developed social market economy and a high standard of living until the one nine eight zero s many of austria s largest industry firms were nationalised however in recent years privatisation has reduced state holdings to a level comparable to other european economies labour movements are particularly strong in austria and have large influence on labour politics germany has historically been the main trading partner of austria making it vulnerable to rapid changes in the german economy slow growth in germany and elsewhere in the world affected austria slowing its growth to one two in two zero zero one but since austria became a member state of the european union it has gained closer ties to other european union economies reducing its economic dependence on germany in addition membership in the eu has drawn an influx of foreign investors attracted by austria s access to the single european market and proximity to eu aspiring economies therefore estimates of growth in two zero zero five up to two are much more favourable than in the crippling german economy agriculture austrian farms like those of other west european mountainous countries are small and fragmented and production is relatively expensive industry although some industries such as several iron and steel works and chemical plants are large industrial enterprises employing thousands of people most industrial and commercial enterprises in austria are relatively small on an international scale services like in other western countries the biggest contributor to austria s gdp is its service sector most notably is tourism especially winter tourism to meet increased competition from both eu and central european countries austria will need to emphasize knowledge based sectors of the economy continue to deregulate the service sector and lower its tax burden see also list of austrian companies demographics vienna during the first half of the one eight th century painting by canaletto austria s capital vienna is one of europe s major cities with a population exceeding one six million two million with suburbs and constitutes a melting

other cities have fewer than one zero zero zero zero zero inhabitants austrians of german mother tongue by far the country s largest group form nine one one of austria s population the remaining number of austria s people are of non austrian descent many from surrounding countries especially from the former east bloc nations the austrian federal states of carinthia and styria are home to a significant indigenous slovenian minority with around one four zero zero zero members austrian census unofficial numbers of slovene groups speak of about four zero zero zero zero so called guest workers gastarbeiter and their descendants also form an important minority group in austria around two zero zero zero zero hungarians and three zero zero zero zero croatians live in the east most bundesland burgenland formerly part of hungary the official language german is spoken by almost all residents of the country austria s mountainous terrain led to the development of many distinct german dialects all of the dialects in the country however belong to austro bavarian groups of german dialects with the exception of the dialect spoken in its west most bundesland vorarlberg which belongs to the group of alemannic dialects there is also a distinct grammatical standard for austrian german with a few differences to the german spoken in germany politics concerning ethnic groups volksgruppenpolitik an estimated two five zero zero zero four zero zero zero zero slovenians in the austrian state of carinthia as well as croatians and hungarians in burgenland were recognized as a minority and have enjoyed special rights following the austrian state treaty staatsvertrag of one nine five five the slovenians in the austrian state of styria estimated at a number between one six zero zero and five zero zero zero are not recognized as a minority and do not enjoy special rights although the state treaty of july two seven one nine five five states otherwise the right for bilingual topographic signs for the regions where slovene and croatian speaking austrians live alongside with the german speaking population as required by the one nine five five state treaty is still to be fully implemented there is also an undercurrent of thinking amongst parts of the carenthian population that the slovenian involvement in the partisan war against the nazi occupation force was a bad thing and indeed tito partisan is a not an infrequent insult hurled against members of the minority many carinthians are afraid of slovenian territorial claims pointing to the fact that yugoslav troops entered the state after each of the two world wars and considering that some official slovenian atlases still show parts of carinthia as slovenian cultural territory the current governor j rg haider has made this fact a matter of public argument in fall two zero zero five by refusing to increase the number of bilingual topographic signs in carinthia a poll by the k rntner humaninstitut conducted in january two zero zero six states that six five of carinthians are not in favour of an increase of bilingual topographic signs since the original requirements set by the state treaty of one nine five five have already been fulfilled according to their point of view another interesting phenomenon is the so called windischen theorie stating that the slovenians can be split in two groups actual slovenians and windische based on differences in language between austrian slovenians who were taught slovenian standard language in school and those slovenians who spoke their local slovenian dialect but went to german schools to the latter group the term windische originally the german word for slovenians was applied claiming that they were a different ethnic group this theory was never generally accepted and has been ultimately rejected several decades ago list of cities in austria religion charles v austrian habsburg ruler and one of the major figures within the counter reformation while northern and central germany was the origin of the reformation austria and bavaria were the heart of the counter reformation in the one six th and one seven th century when the absolute monarchy of habsburg imposed a strict regime to maintain catholicism s power and influence among austrians despite this establishment of catholicism as the predominant christian religion protestants have throughout austria s history remained a relatively small group austria s history as a multinational state has made it necessary for habsburg rulers to deal with a heterogeneous religious population religious freedom was declared a constitutional right as early as one eight six seven and austria hungary was home of numerous religions beside roman catholicism such as greek serbian romanian russian and bulgarian orthodox christians jews muslims austria neighboured the ottoman empire for centuries mormons and both calvinists and lutheran protestants still austria remained largely influenced by catholicism after one nine one eight first republic catholic leaders such as theodor innitzer and ignaz seipel took leading positions within or close to the austrian government and increased their influence during the time of the austrofascism catholicism was treated much like a state religion by dictators engelbert dollfuss and kurt schuschnigg although catholic leaders welcomed the germans in one nine three eight during the anschluss of austria into germany austrian catholicism stopped its support of nazism later on and many former religious public figures became involved with the resistance during the third reich after one nine four five a stricter secularism was imposed in austria and religious influence on politics has nearly vanished as of the end of the two zero th century about seven three of austria s population are registered as roman catholic while about five consider themselves protestants both these numbers have been on the decline for decades especially roman catholicism which has suffered an increasing number of seceders of the church this is due partly to child sexual abuse scandals by priests as well as the alleged unwillingness of the roman catholic church to implement reforms in addition austrian catholics are obliged to pay a mandatory tax calculated by income ca one to the austrian roman catholic church which acts as another incentive to leave the church about one two of the population declare that they do not belong to any church or religious community of the remaining people about one eight zero zero zero zero are members of the eastern orthodox church and about seven three zero zero are jewish it has to be noted that the austrian jewish community of one nine three eight vienna alone counted more than two zero zero zero zero zero of which solely four zero zero zero to five zero zero zero remained after the second world war the influx of eastern europeans especially from the former yugoslav nations albania and particularly from turkey largely contributed to a substantial muslim minority in austria around three zero zero zero zero zero are registered as members of various muslim communities the numbers of people adhering to the islam has increased largely during the last years and is expected to grow in the future buddhism which was legally recognized as a religion in austria in one nine eight three enjoys widespread acceptance and has a following of two zero zero zero zero one zero four zero two at the two zero zero one census a two zero zero five survey among eight zero zero zero people in

although austria is a small country its history as a world power and its unique cultural environment in the heart of europe have generated contributions to mankind in every possible field one might argue that austria is internationally best known for its musicians it has been the birthplace of many famous composers such as wolfgang amadeus mozart joseph haydn franz schubert anton bruckner johann strauss sr johann strauss jr or gustav mahler as well as members of the second viennese school such as arnold schoenberg anton webern or alban berg complementing its status as a land of artists

zero zero years by indigenous australians after sporadic visits by fishermen from the north and by european explorers and merchants starting in the one seven th century the eastern half of the continent was claimed by the british in one seven seven zero and officially settled as the penal colony of new south wales on two six january one seven eight eight as the population grew and new areas were explored another five largely self governing british crown colonies were successively established over the course of the one nine th century on one january one nine zero one the six colonies federated and the commonwealth of australia was formed since federation australia has maintained a stable liberal democratic political system and remains a commonwealth realm the current population of around two zero four million is concentrated mainly in the large coastal cities of sydney melbourne brisbane perth and adelaide origin and history of the name the name australia is derived from the latin australis meaning southern legends of an unknown southern land terra australis incognita date back to the roman times and were commonplace in mediaeval geography but they were not based on any actual knowledge of the continent the dutch adjectival form australische australian in the sense of southern was used by dutch officials in batavia to refer to the newly discovered land to the south as early as one six three eight the first use of the word australia in english was a one six nine three translation of les aventures de jacques sadeur dans la d couverte et le voyage de la terre australe a one six nine two french novel by gabriel de foigny under the pen name jacques sadeur alexander dalrymple then used it in an historical collection of voyages and discoveries in the south pacific ocean published in one seven seven one he used the term to refer to the entire south pacific region not specifically to the australian continent in one seven nine three george shaw and sir james smith published zoology and botany of new holland in which they wrote of the vast island or rather continent of australia australasia or new holland view of port jackson taken from the south head from a voyage to terra australis sydney was established on this site the name australia was popularised by the one eight one four work a voyage to terra australis by the navigator matthew flinders despite its title which reflected the view of the admiralty flinders used the word australia in the book which was widely read and gave the term general currency governor lachlan macquarie of new south wales subsequently used the word in his dispatches to england in one eight one seven he recommended that it be officially adopted in one eight two four the british admiralty agreed that the continent should be known officially as australia the word australia in australian english is pronounced as either or history the first human habitation of australia is estimated to have occurred between four two zero zero zero and four eight zero zero zero years ago the first australians were the ancestors of the current indigenous australians they arrived via land bridges and short sea crossings from present day southeast asia most of these people were hunter gatherers with a complex oral culture and spiritual values based on reverence for the land and a belief in the dreamtime the torres strait islanders ethnically melanesian inhabited the torres strait islands and parts of far north queensland they possess distinct cultural practices from the aborigines lieutenant james cook charted the east coast of australia on hm bark endeavour claiming the land for britain in one seven seven zero this replica was built in fremantle in one nine eight eight for australia s bicentenary the first undisputed recorded european sighting of the australian continent was made by the dutch navigator willem jansz who sighted the coast of cape york peninsula in one six zero six during the one seven th century the dutch charted the whole of the western and northern coastlines of what they called new holland but made no attempt at settlement in one seven seven zero james cook sailed along and mapped the east coast of australia which he named new south wales and claimed for britain the expedition s discoveries provided impetus for the establishment of a penal colony there following the loss of the american colonies that had previously filled that role port arthur tasmania was australia s largest penal colony the british crown colony of new south wales started with the establishment of a settlement at port jackson by captain arthur phillip on two six january one seven eight eight this date was later to become australia s national day australia day van diemen s land now known as tasmania was settled in one eight zero three and became a separate colony in one eight two five the united kingdom formally claimed the western part of australia in one eight two nine separate colonies were created from parts of new south wales south australia in one eight three six victoria in one eight five one and queensland in one eight five nine the northern territory nt was founded in one eight six three as part of the province of south australia victoria and south australia were founded as free colonies that is they were never penal colonies although the former did receive some convicts from tasmania western australia was also founded free but later accepted transported convicts due to an acute labour shortage the transportation of convicts to australia was phased out between one eight four zero and one eight six eight the indigenous australian population estimated at about three five zero zero zero zero at the time of european settlement declined steeply for one five zero years following settlement mainly due to infectious disease forced migration the removal of children and other colonial government policies that some historians and indigenous australians have argued could be considered tantamount to genocide by today s understanding such interpretations of aboriginal history are disputed by some as being exaggerated or fabricated for political or ideological reasons this debate is known within australia as the history wars following the one nine six seven referendum the federal government gained the power to implement policies and make laws with respect to aborigines traditional ownership of land native title was not recognised until the high court case mabo v queensland no two overturned the notion of australia as terra nullius at the time of european occupation the last post is played at an anzac day ceremony in port melbourne victoria two five april two zero zero five ceremonies such as this are held in virtually every suburb and town in australia a gold rush began in australia in the early one eight five zero s and the eureka stockade rebellion in one eight five four was an early expression of nationalist sentiment between one eight five five and one eight nine zero the six colonies individually gained responsible government managing most of their own affairs while remaining part of the british empire the colonial office in london retained control of some matters notably foreign affairs defence and international shipping on one january one nine zero one federation of the colonies was achieved after a decade of planning consultation and voting and the commonwealth of australia was born as a dominion of the british empire the australian capital territory act was formed from new south wales in one nine one one to provide a location for the proposed new federal capital of canberra melbourne was the capital from one nine zero one to one nine two seven the northern territory was transferred from the control of the south australian government to the commonwealth in one nine one one australia willingly participated in world war i many australians regard the defeat of the australian and new zealand army corps anzacs at gallipoli as the birth of the nation its first major military action the gallipoli campaign is often erroneously portrayed as or conceived to have been a solely or mainly anzac campaign the reality was that british deaths during the campaign were twice as high as those of anzac forces much like gallipoli the kokoda track campaign is regarded by many as a nation defining battle from world war ii the statute of westminster one nine three one formally ended most of the constitutional links between australia and the united kingdom but australia did not adopt the statute until one nine four two the shock of the united kingdom s defeat in asia in one nine four two and the threat of japanese invasion caused australia to turn to the united states as a new ally and protector since one nine five one australia has been a formal military ally of the us under the auspices of the anzus treaty after world war ii australia encouraged mass immigration from europe since the one nine seven zero s and the abolition of the white australia policy immigration from asia and other parts of the world was also encouraged as a result australia s demography culture and image of itself were radically transformed the final constitutional ties between australia and the united kingdom ended in one nine eight six with the passing of the australia act one nine eight six ending any british role in the australian states and ending judicial appeals to the uk privy council australian voters rejected a move to become a republic in one nine nine nine by a five five majority but the result is generally viewed in terms of dissatisfaction with the specifics of the proposed republican model rather than attachment to the monarchy since the election of the whitlam government in one nine seven two there has been an increasing focus on the nation s future as a part of the asia pacific region politics new parliament house in canberra was opened in one nine eight eight replacing the provisional parliament house building opened in one nine two seven the commonwealth of australia is a constitutional monarchy and has a parliamentary system of government queen elizabeth ii is the queen of australia a role that is distinct from her position as elizabeth ii of the united kingdom the queen is nominally represented by the governor general although the constitution gives extensive executive powers to the governor general these are normally exercised only on the advice of the prime minister the most notable exercise of the governor general s reserve powers outside the prime minister s direction was the dismissal of the whitlam government in the constitutional crisis of one nine seven five there are three branches of government the legislature the commonwealth parliament comprising the queen the senate and the house of representatives the queen is represented by the governor general who in practice exercises little or no power over the parliament the executive the federal executive council the governor general as advised by the executive councillors in practice the councillors are the prime minister and ministers of state whose advice the governor general accepts with rare exceptions the judiciary the high court of australia and other federal courts the state courts became formally independent from the judicial committee of the privy council when the australia act was passed in one nine eight six the bicameral commonwealth parliament consists of the queen the senate the upper house of seven six senators and a house of representatives the lower house of one five zero members members of the lower house are elected from single member constituencies commonly known as electorates or seats seats in the house of representatives are allocated to states on the basis of population in the senate each state regardless of population is represented by one two senators with the act and the nt each electing two elections for both chambers are held every three years typically only half of the senate seats are put to each election because senators have overlapping six year terms the party with majority support in the house of representatives forms government with its leader becoming prime minister there are three major political parties the labor party the liberal party and the national party independent members and several minor parties including the greens family first and the australian democrats have achieved representation in australian parliaments mostly in upper houses although their influence has been marginal since the one nine nine six election the liberal national coalition led by the prime minister john howard has been in power in canberra in the two zero zero four election the coalition won control of the senate the first time that a party or coalition of governing parties has done so while in government in more than two zero years the labor party is in power in every state and territory voting is compulsory in each state and territory and at the federal level states and territories states and territories of australia australia consists of six states two major mainland territories and other minor territories the states are new south wales queensland south australia tasmania victoria and western australia the two major mainland territories are the northern territory and the australian capital territory in most respects the territories function similarly to the states but the commonwealth parliament can override any legislation of their parliaments by contrast federal legislation overrides state legislation only with respect to certain areas as set out in section five one of the constitution all residual legislative powers are retained by the state parliaments including powers over hospitals education police the judiciary roads public transport and local government each state and territory has its own legislature unicameral in the case of the northern territory the act and queensland and bicameral in the remaining states the lower house is known as the legislative assembly house of assembly in south australia and tasmania and the upper house the legislative council the heads of the governments in each state and territory are called premiers and chief ministers respectively the queen is represented in each state by a governor an administrator in the northern territory and the governor general in the act have analogous roles australia also has several minor territories the federal government administers a separate area within new south wales the jervis bay territory as a naval base and sea port for the national capital in addition australia has the following inhabited external territories norfolk island christmas island cocos keeling islands and several largely uninhabited external territories ashmore and cartier islands coral sea islands heard island and mcdonald islands and the australian antarctic territory foreign relations and military over recent decades australia s foreign relations have been driven by a close association with the united states through the anzus pact and by a desire to develop relationships with asia and the pacific

cooperation australia is a member of the commonwealth of nations in which the commonwealth heads of government meetings provide the main forum for co operation much of australia s diplomatic energy is

corners have a temperate climate and moderately fertile soil the northern part of the country has a tropical climate part is tropical rainforests part grasslands and very little desert australia receives snowfall in some cities but mostly in towns and at higher evaluations climate is highly influenced by ocean currents including the el ni o southern oscillation which is correlated with periodic drought and the seasonal tropical low pressure system that produces cyclones in northern australia rainfall is highly variable with frequent droughts rising levels of salinity and desertification in some areas australia is situated in the middle of the tectonic plate and therefore has no active volcanism only extinct volcanos although it may sometimes receive minor earthquakes the terrain is mostly heavily weathered low plateau with deserts rangelands and a fertile plain in southeast tasmania and the australian alps do not contain any permanent icefields or glaciers although they may have existed in the past the great barrier reef by far the world s largest coral reef lies a short distance off the north east coast mount augustus in western australia is the largest monolith in the world flora and fauna the koala and the eucalyptus make an iconic pair of australian flora and fauna although most of australia is semi arid or desert it covers a diverse range of habitats from alpine heaths to tropical rainforests because of the great age and consequent low levels of fertility of the continent its extremely variable weather patterns and its long term geographic isolation much of australia s biota is unique and diverse about eight five of flowering plants eight four of mammals more than four five of birds and eight nine of in shore temperate zone fish are endemic many of australia s ecoregions and the species within those regions are threatened by human activities and introduced plant and animal species the federal environment protection and

two dos text adventure an astronomer or astrophysicist is a person whose area of interest is astronomy or astrophysics johannes hevelius was famed for his work on sunspots and being the first to study the surface of the moon astronomy is generally thought to have begun in ancient babylon by the persian zoroastrian priests the magi recent studies of babylonian records have shown them to be extremely accurate for the ancient night sky following the babylonians the egyptians also had an emphasis on observations of the sky mixtures of religious interpretations of the sky and the development of complex models for applying these interpretations led to a duality that we now identify as astrology it is important to recognize that before about one seven five zero there was no distinction between astrology and astronomy astronomers unlike most scientists cannot interact with the objects that they study they instead must resort to detailed observation in order to make discoveries generally astronomers use telescopes or other imaging equipment to make such observations the job itself is involved with travel to remote locations to study as well famous astronomers see also amateur astronomy list of astronomers there is also a well known painting by johannes vermeer titled the astronomer which is often linked to vermeer s the geographer these paintings are both thought to

foraminiferan ammonia tepida heliozoan actinophrys sol amoeboids are cells that move or feed by means of temporary projections called pseudopods false feet they have appeared in a number of different groups some cells in multicellular animals may be amoeboid for instance our white blood cells which consume pathogens many protists exist as individual amoeboid cells or take such a form at some point in their life cycle the most famous such organism is amoeba proteus the name amoebae is variously used to describe its close relatives other organisms similar to it or the amoeboids in general amoeboids may be divided into several morphological categories based on the form and structure of the pseudopods those where the pseudopods are supported by regular arrays of microtubules are called actinopods and forms where they are not are called rhizopods further divided into lobse filose and reticulose amoebae there is also a strange group of giant marine amoeboids the xenophyophores that do not fall into any of these categories lobose pseudopods are blunt and there may be one or several on a cell which is usually divided into a layer of clear ectoplasm surrounding more granular endoplasm most including amoeba itself move by the body mass flowing into an anterior pseudopod the vast majority form a monophyletic group called the amoebozoa which also includes most slime moulds a second group the percolozoa includes protists that can transform between amoeboid and flagellate forms filose pseudopods are narrow and tapering the vast majority of filose amoebae including all those that produce shells are placed within the cercozoa together with various flagellates that tend to have amoeboid forms the naked filose amoebae comprise two other groups the vampyrellids and nucleariids the latter appear to be close relatives of animals and fungi reticulose pseudopods are cytoplasmic strands that branch and merge to form a net they are found most notably among the foraminifera a large group of marine protists that generally produce multi chambered shells there are only a few sorts of naked reticulose amoeboids notably the gymnophryids and their relationships are not certain actinopods are divided into the radiolaria and heliozoa the radiolaria are mostly marine protists with complex internal skeletons including central capsules that divide the cells into granular endoplasm and frothy ectoplasm that keeps them buoyant the heliozoa include both freshwater and marine forms that use their axopods to capture small prey and only have simple scales or spines for skeletal elements both groups appear to be polyphyletic traditionally the amoeboid protozoa are grouped together as the sarcodina variously ranked from class to phylum with each of the above categories as a formal subtaxon however since they are all based on form rather than phylogeny newer systems generally separate some out or abandon them entirely most amoeboids are now included in two major supergroups the amoebozoa including most lobose amoebae and slime moulds and the rhizaria including the cercozoa foraminifera radiolarian classes and certain heliozoa however amoeboids have appeared separately in many other groups including various different lines of algae not listed above external links the amoebae website brings together information from published sources amoebas are

ode for i nformation i nterchange generally pronounced is a character encoding based on the english alphabet ascii codes represent text in computers communications equipment and other devices that work with text most modern character encodings have a historical basis in ascii ascii was first published as a standard in one nine six seven and was last updated in one nine eight six it currently defines codes for three three non printing mostly obsolete control characters that affect how text is processed plus the following nine five printable characters starting with the space character abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz asteroid three five six eight ascii is named after the character encoding overview like other character representation computer codes ascii specifies a correspondence between digital bit patterns and the symbols glyphs of a written language thus allowing digital devices to communicate with each other and to process store and communicate character oriented information the ascii character encoding or a compatible extension see below is used on nearly all common computers especially personal computers and workstations the preferred mime name for this encoding is us ascii ascii is strictly a seven bit code meaning that it uses the bit patterns representable with seven binary digits a range of zero to one two seven decimal to represent character information at the time ascii was introduced many computers dealt with eight bit groups bytes or more specifically octets as the smallest unit of information the eighth bit was commonly used as a parity bit for error checking on communication lines or other device specific functions machines which did not use parity typically set the eighth bit to zero though some systems such as prime machines running primos set the eighth bit of ascii characters to one ascii only defines a relationship between specific characters and bit sequences aside from reserving a few control codes for line oriented formatting it does not define any mechanism for describing the structure or appearance of text within a document such concepts are within the realm of other systems such as the markup languages history ascii developed from telegraphic codes and first entered commercial use as a seven bit teleprinter code promoted by bell data services the bell system had previously planned to use a six bit code derived from fieldata that added punctuation and lower case letters to the earlier five bit baudot teleprinter code but was persuaded instead to join the asa subcommittee that had started to develop ascii baudot helped in the automation of sending and receiving telegraphic messages and took many features from morse code however unlike morse code baudot used constant length codes compared to earlier telegraph codes the proposed bell code and ascii both underwent re ordering for more convenient sorting especially alphabetization of lists and added features for devices other than teleprinters bob bemer introduced features such as the escape sequence the american standards association asa later to become ansi first published ascii as a standard in one nine six three ascii one nine six three lacked the lowercase letters and had an up arrow instead of the caret and a left arrow instead of the underscore the one nine six seven version added the lowercase letters changed the names of a few control characters and moved the two controls ack and esc from the lowercase letters area into the control codes area ascii was subsequently updated and published as ansi x three four one nine six eight ansi x three four one nine seven seven and finally ansi x three four one nine eight six other international standards bodies have ratified character encodings that are identical or nearly identical to ascii these encodings are sometimes referred to as ascii even though ascii is strictly defined only by the asa ansi standards the european computer manufacturers association published editions of its ascii clone ecma six in one nine six five one nine six seven one nine seven zero one nine seven three one nine eight three and one nine nine one the one nine nine one edition is the same as ansi x three four one nine eight six the international organization for standardization published its version iso six four six later iso iec six four six in one nine six seven one nine seven two one nine eight three and one nine nine one iso six four six one nine seven two in particular established a set of country specific versions with punctuation characters replaced with non english letters iso iec six four six one nine nine one international reference version is the same as ansi x three four one nine eight six the international telecommunication union published its version of ansi x three four one nine eight six itu t recommendation t five zero in one nine nine two in the early one nine seven zero s under the name ccitt the same organization published a version as ccitt recommendation v three din published a version of ascii as din six six zero zero three in one nine seven four the ietf published a version in one nine six nine as rfc two zero and established the internet s standard version based on ansi x three four one nine eight six with the publication of rfc one three four five in one nine nine two ibm s version of ansi x three four one nine eight six is published in ibm technical literature as code page three six seven ascii has also become embedded in its probable replacement unicode as the lowest one two eight characters some observers consider ascii the most successful software standard ever promulgated ascii control characters ascii reserves the first three two codes numbers zero three one decimal for control characters codes originally intended not to carry printable information but rather to control devices such as printers that make use of ascii for example character one zero represents the line feed function which causes a printer to advance its paper and character two seven represents the escape key often found in the top left corner of common keyboards code one two seven all seven bits on another special character equates to delete or rubout though its function resembles that of other control characters the designers of ascii used this pattern so that it could erase a section of paper tape a popular storage medium until the one nine eight zero s by punching all possible holes at a particular character position thus effectively replacing any previous information since code zero null all bits off was also ignored it was possible to leave gaps and then make corrections by blanking characters before or after the gap and then entering new characters in the gap many of the ascii control codes serve or served to mark data packets or to control a data transmission protocol e g enquiry effectively any stations out there acknowledge negative acknowledge start of header start of text end of text etc escape and substitute permit a communications protocol to for instance mark binary data so that if it contains codes with the same pattern as a protocol character the recipient will process the code as data the designers of ascii intended the separator characters record separator etc for use with magnetic tape systems two of the device control characters commonly interpreted as xon and xoff generally function as flow control characters to throttle data flow to a slow device such as a printer from a fast device such as a computer so data does not overrun and get lost early users of ascii adopted some of the control codes to represent meta information such as end of line start end of a data element and so on these assignments often conflict so part of the effort in converting data from one format to another involves making the correct meta information transformations for example the character s representing end of line newline in text data files streams vary from operating system to operating system when moving files from one system to another the conversion process must recognize these characters as end of line markers and handle them appropriately today ascii users use the control characters less and less with the exception of carriage return and or line feed modern markup languages modern communication protocols the move from text based to graphical devices and the demise of teleprinters punch cards and paper tapes have rendered most of the control characters obsolete printable representation the unicode glyphs reserved for representing control characters when it is necessary to print or display them rather than have them perform their intended function control key sequence the traditional key sequences for inputting control characters the caret represents the control or ctrl key that must be held down while pressing the second key in the sequence the caret key representation is also used by some software to represent control characters the backspace character can also be entered by pressing the backspace bksp or key on some systems the delete character can also be entered by pressing the delete or del key it can also be entered by pressing the backspace bksp or key on some systems the escape character can also be entered by pressing the escape or esc key on some systems the carriage return character can also be entered by pressing the return ret enter or key on most systems the ambiguity surrounding the backspace key comes from systems that translated the del control character into a bs backspace before transmitting it some software was unable to process the character and would display h instead h persists in messages today as a deliberate humorous device e g there s a sucker h h h h h hpotential customer born every minute a less common variant of this involves the use of w which in some text editors means delete previous word the example sentence would therefore also work as there s a sucker w potential customer born every minute ascii printable characters code three two the space character denotes the space between words as produced by the large space bar of a keyboard codes three three to one two six known as the printable characters represent letters digits punctuation marks and a few miscellaneous symbols seven bit ascii provided seven national characters and if the combined hardware and software permit can use overstrikes to simulate some additional international characters in such a scenario a backspace can precede a grave accent which the american and british standards but only those standards also call opening single quotation mark a tilde or a breath mark inverted vel zero one one one one one one zero one two six seven e structural features the digits zero nine are represented with their values in binary prefixed with zero zero one one this means that bcd ascii is simply a matter of taking each bcd nibble separately and prefixing zero zero one one to it lowercase and uppercase letters only differ in bit pattern by a single bit simplifying case conversion to a range test to avoid converting characters that are not letters and a single bitwise operation aliases for ascii rfc one three four five published in june one nine nine two and the iana registry of character sets ongoing both recognize the following case insensitive aliases for ascii as suitable for use on the internet ansi x three four one nine six eight canonical name ansi x three four one nine eight six ascii us ascii preferred mime name us iso six four six us iso six four six irv one nine nine one iso ir six ibm three six seven cp three six seven csascii of these only the aliases us ascii and ascii have achieved widespread use one often finds them in the optional charset parameter in the content type header of some mime messages in the equivalent meta element of some html documents and in the encoding declaration part of the prolog of some xml documents variants of ascii as computer technology spread throughout the world different standards bodies and corporations developed many variations of ascii in order to facilitate the expression of non english languages that used roman based alphabets one could class some of these variations as ascii extensions although some mis apply that term to cover all variants including those that do not preserve ascii s character map in the seven bit range iso six four six one nine seven two the first attempt to remedy the pro english language bias created compatibility problems since it remained a seven bit character set it made no additional codes available so it reassigned some in language specific variants it thus became impossible to know what character a code represented without knowing which variant to work with and text processing systems could generally cope with only one variant anyway eventually improved technology brought out of band means to represent the information formerly encoded in the eighth bit of each byte freeing this bit to add another one two eight additional character codes for new assignments for example ibm developed eight bit code pages such as code page four three seven which replaced the control characters with graphic symbols such as smiley faces and mapped additional graphic characters to the upper one two eight bytes operating systems such as dos supported these code pages and manufacturers of ibm pcs supported them in hardware eight bit standards such as iso iec eight eight five nine and mac os roman developed as true extensions of ascii leaving the original character mapping intact and just adding additional values above the seven bit range this enabled the representation of a broader range of languages but these standards continued to suffer from incompatibilities and limitations still iso eight eight five nine one its variant windows one two five two often mislabeled as iso eight eight five nine one and original seven bit ascii remain the most common character encodings in use today unicode and the iso iec one zero six four six universal character set ucs have a much wider array of characters and their various encoding forms have begun to supplant iso iec eight eight five nine and ascii rapidly in many environments while ascii basically uses seven bit codes unicode and the ucs use relatively abstract code points non negative integer numbers that map using different encoding forms and schemes to sequences of one or more eight bit bytes to permit backward compatibility unicode and the ucs assign the first one two eight code points to the same characters as ascii one can therefore think of ascii as a seven bit encoding scheme for a very small subset of unicode and of the ucs the popular utf eight encoding form prescribes the use of one to four eight bit code values for each code point character and equates exactly to ascii for the code values below one two eight other encoding forms such as utf one six resemble ascii in how they represent the first one two eight characters of unicode but tend to use one six or three two bits per character so they require conversion for compatibility the blend word asciibetical has

s total surface area and two zero three of the total land area with over eight four zero zero zero zero zero zero zero people as of two zero zero five in six one territories it accounts for more than one two of the world s human population etymology world map showing africa geographically the name africa came into western use through the romans who used the name africa terra land of the afri plural or afer singular for the northern part of the continent as the province of africa with its capital carthage corresponding to modern day tunisia the afri were a tribe possibly berber who dwelt in north africa in the carthage area the origin of afer may be connected with phoenician afar dust also found in most other semitic languages some other etymologies that have been postulated for the ancient name africa that are much more debatable include the latin word aprica meaning sunny the greek word aphrike meaning without cold see also list of traditional greek place names the historian leo africanus one four nine five one five five four attributed the origin to the greek word phrike meaning cold and horror combined with the negating prefix a so meaning a land free of cold and horror however the change of sound from ph to f in greek is datable to about the first century so this is unlikely to be the origin ancient africa extended into what is now known as asia there was no line drawn between the two continents until the geographer ptolemy eight five one six five ad accepted alexandria as prime meridian and made the isthmus of suez and the red sea the boundary between asia and africa as europeans came to understand the real extent of the continent the idea of africa expanded with their knowledge geography main article geography of africa africa in the blue marble

three seven six zero zero zero zero square miles has a coast line of three two zero zero zero km one nine eight zero zero miles the main structural lines of the continent show both the east to west direction characteristic at least in the eastern hemisphere of the more northern parts of the world and the north to south direction seen in the southern peninsulas africa is thus composed of two segments at right angles the northern running from east to west the southern from north to south the subordinate lines corresponding in the main to these two directions history main article history of africa map of africa one eight nine zero africa is home to the oldest inhabited territory on earth with the human race originating from this continent during the mid two zero th century

like all other continents had no nation states and was instead inhabited by groups of hunter gatherers such as the khoi and san formerly known as bushmen around three three zero zero bc the historical record opens in africa with the rise of literacy in egypt which continued with varying levels of influence over other areas until three four three bc other prominent civilizations include ethiopia the nubian kingdom carthage the kingdoms of the sahel ghana mali and songhai and great zimbabwe in one four eight two the portuguese established the first of many trading stations along the guinea coast at elmina the chief commodities dealt in were slaves gold ivory and spices the european discovery of america in one four nine two was followed by a great development of the slave trade which before the portuguese era had been an overland trade almost exclusively and never confined to any one continent but at the same time that slavery was ending in europe in the early one nine th century the european imperial powers staged a massive scramble for africa and occupied most of the continent creating many colonial nation states and leaving only two independent nations liberia the black american colony and ethiopia this occupation continued until after the conclusion of the second world war when all colonial states gradually obtained formal independence today africa is home to over five zero independent countries all but two of which still have the borders drawn up during the era of european colonialism politics map showing european claimants to the african continent at the beginning of world war i precolonial africa colonial africa colonialism had a destabilizing effect on what had been a number of ethnic groups that is still being felt in african politics prior to european influence national borders were not much of a concern with africans generally following the practice of other areas of the world such as the arabian peninsula where a group s territory was congruent with its military or trade influence the european insistence of drawing borders around territories to isolate them from those of other colonial powers often had the effect of separating otherwise contiguous political groups or forcing traditional enemies to live side by side with no buffer between them for example the congo river although it appears to be a natural geographic boundary had groups that otherwise shared a language culture or other similarity who resided on both sides the division of the land between belgium and france along the river isolated these groups from each other those who lived in saharan or sub saharan africa and traded across the continent for centuries often found themselves crossing borders that existed only on european maps in nations that had substantial european populations for example rhodesia and south africa systems of second class citizenship were often set up in order to give europeans political power far in excess of their numbers however the lines were not often drawn strictly across racial lines in liberia the citizens who were descendants of american slaves managed to have a political system for over one zero zero years that gave ex slaves and natives to the area roughly equal legislative power despite the fact the ex slaves were outnumbered ten to one in the general population the inspiration for this system was the united states senate which had balanced the power of free and slave states despite the much larger population of the former europeans often changed the balance of power created ethnic divides where they did not previously exist and introduced a cultural dichotomy detrimental to the native inhabitants in the areas they controlled for example in what is now rwanda and burundi two ethnic groups hutus and tutsis had merged into one culture by the time belgian colonists had taken control of the region in the one nine th century no longer divided by ethnicity as intermingling inter marriage and merging of cultural practices over the centuries had long since erased visible signs of a culture divide the belgians instituted a policy of racial categorization upon taking control of the region as racial based categorization and philosophies was a fixture of the european culture of that time the term hutu originally referred to the agricultural based bantu speaking tribes that moved into present day rwandan and burundi from the west and the term tutsi referred to north eastern cattle based tribes that migrated into the region later the terms to the indigenous peoples eventually came to describe a person s economic class those individuals who owned roughly one zero or more cattle were considered tutsi and those with fewer were considered hutu regardless of ancestral history this was not a strict line but a general rule of thumb and one could move from hutu to tutsi and vice versa the belgians introduced a racialised system those individuals who had characteristics the europeans admired fairer skin ample height narrow noses etc were given power amongst the colonized peoples the belgians determined these features were more ideally hamitic hamitic in turn being more ideally european and belonged to those people closest to tutsi in ancestry they instituted a policy of issuing identity cards based on this philosophy those closest to this ideal were proclaimed tutsi and those not were proclaimed hutu post colonial africa since independence african states have frequently been hampered by instability corruption violence and authoritarianism the vast majority of african nations are republics that operate under some form of the presidential system of rule few nations in africa have been able to sustain democratic governments instead cycling through a series of brutal coups and military dictatorships a number of africa s post colonial political leaders were poorly educated and ignorant on matters of governance great instability however was mainly the result of marginalization of other ethnic groups and graft under these leaders as well many used the positions of power to ignite ethnic conflicts that had been exacerbated or even created under colonial rule in many countries the military was perceived as being the only group that could effectively maintain order and ruled most nations in africa during the seven zero s and early eight zero s during the period from the early one nine six zero s to the late one nine eight zero s africa had over seven zero coups and one three presidential assassinations cold war conflicts between the united states and the soviet union also played a role in the instability when a country became independent for the first time it was often expected to align with one of the two superpowers many countries in northern africa received soviet military aid while many in central and southern africa were supported by the united states and or france the one nine seven zero s saw an escalation as newly independent angola and mozambique aligned themselves with the soviet union and the west and south africa sought to contain soviet influence border and territorial disputes have also been common with the european imposed borders of many nations being widely contested through armed conflicts failed government policies and political corruption have also resulted in many widespread famines and significant portions of africa remain with distribution systems unable to disseminate enough food or water for the population to survive the spread of disease is also rampant especially the spread of the human immunodeficiency virus hiv and the associated acquired immune deficiency syndrome aids which has become a deadly epidemic on the continent despite numerous hardships there have been some signs the continent has hope for the future democratic governments seem to be spreading though are not yet the majority national geographic claims one three african nations can be considered truly democratic as well many nations have at least nominally recognized basic human rights for all citizens though in practice these are not always recognized and have created reasonably independent judiciaries there are clear signs of increased networking among african organisations and states in the civil war in the democratic republic of congo former zaire rather than rich non african countries intervening about half a dozen neighbouring african countries got involved see also second congo war the death toll has been estimated by some to be three five million since the conflict began in one nine nine eight this might play a role similar to that of world war ii for europe after which the people in the neighbouring countries decide to integrate their societies in such a way that war between them becomes as unthinkable as a war between say france and germany would be today political associations such as the african union are also offering hope for greater co operation and peace between the continent s many countries extensive human rights abuses still occur in several parts of africa often under the oversight of the state most of such violations occur for political reasons often times as a side effect of civil war countries where major human rights violations have been reported in recent times include the democratic republic of the congo sierra leone liberia sudan and c te d ivoire modern africa most western countries place limitations on aid to african nations especially the united states these limitations are often used to control the governments of these african nations as a result these nations are turning to non traditional sources of financial aid china has increasingly provided financial aid to africa in order to secure contracts on natural resources such as oil gold and diamonds there usually is no political prescription countries the chinese are investing in include central african republic plantations nigeria oil these groups are called north africans and sub saharan africans respectively afro asiatic speaking peoples predominate in north africa while sub saharan africa is dominated by a number of populations grouped according to their language niger congo predominantly in west africa nilo saharan in the eastern highlands and khoisan in the south speakers of bantu languages part of the niger congo family are the majority in southern central and east africa proper but there are also several nilotic groups in east africa and a few remaining indigenous khoisan san or bushmen and pygmy peoples in southern and central africa respectively bantu speaking africans also predominate in gabon and equatorial guinea and are found in parts of southern cameroon and southern somalia in the kalahari desert of southern africa the distinct people known as the bushmen also san closely related to but distinct from hottentots have long been present the san are physically distinct from other africans and are the indigenous people of southern africa pygmies are the pre bantu indigenous peoples of central africa the peoples of north africa comprise two main groups berber and arabic speaking peoples in the west and egyptians in the east the arabs who arrived in the seven th century introduced the arabic language and islam to north africa the semitic phoenicians and the european greeks and romans settled in north africa as well berbers still make up the majority in morocco while they are a significant minority within algeria they are also present in tunisia and libya the tuareg and other often nomadic peoples are the principal inhabitants of the saharan interior of north africa nubians are a nilo saharan speaking group though many also speak arabic who developed an ancient civilization in northeast africa during the past century or so small but economically important colonies of lebanese and chinese have also developed in the larger coastal cities of west and east africa respectively some ethiopian and eritrean groups like the amhara and tigrayans collectively known as habesha have semitic sabaean ancestry the somalis as a people originated in the ethiopian highlands but most somali clans can trace some arab ancestry as well sudan and mauritania are divided between a mostly arabized north and a native african south although the arabs of sudan clearly have a predominantly native african ancestry themselves some areas of east africa particularly the island of zanzibar and the kenyan island of lamu received arab muslim and southwest asian settlers and merchants throughout the middle ages and in antiquity beginning in the one six th century europeans such as the portuguese and dutch began to establish trading posts and forts along the coasts of western and southern africa eventually a large number of dutch augmented by french huguenots and germans settled in what is today south africa their descendants the afrikaners and the coloureds are the largest european descended groups in africa today in the one nine th century a second phase of colonization brought a large number of french and british settlers to africa the portuguese settled mainly in angola but also in mozambique the french settled in large numbers in algeria where they became known collectively as pieds noirs and on a smaller scale in other areas of north and west africa as well as in madagascar the british settled chiefly in south africa as well as the colony of rhodesia and in the highlands of what is now kenya germans settled in what is now tanzania and namibia and there is still a population of german speaking white namibians smaller numbers of european soldiers businessmen and officials also established themselves in administrative centers such as nairobi and dakar decolonization during the one nine six zero s often resulted in the mass emigration of european descended settlers out of africa especially from algeria angola kenya and rhodesia now zimbabwe however in south africa and namibia the white minority remained politically dominant after independence from europe and a significant population of white africans remained in these two countries even after democracy was finally instituted at the end of the cold war south africa has also become the preferred destination of white anglo zimbabweans and of migrants from all over southern africa european colonization also brought sizeable groups of asians particularly people from the indian subcontinent to british colonies large indian communities are found in south africa and smaller ones are present in kenya tanzania and some other southern and east african countries a fairly large indian community in uganda was expelled by the dictator idi amin in one nine seven two though many have since returned the islands in the indian ocean are also populated primarily by people of asian origin often mixed with africans and europeans the malagasy people of madagascar are a malay people but those along the coast are generally mixed with bantu arab indian and european origins malay and indian ancestries are also important components in the group of people known in south africa as coloureds people with origins in two or more races and continents languages map showing the distribution of african language families and some major african languages afro asiatic extends from the sahel to southwest asia niger congo is divided to show the size of the bantu sub family main article african languages by most estimates africa contains well over a thousand languages there are four major language families native to africa the afro asiatic languages are a language family of about two four zero languages and two eight five million people widespread throughout north africa east africa the sahel and southwest asia the nilo saharan language family consists of more than a hundred languages spoken by three zero million people nilo saharan languages are mainly spoken in chad sudan ethiopia uganda kenya and northern tanzania the niger congo language family covers much of sub saharan africa and is probably the largest language family in the world in terms of different languages a substantial number of them are the bantu languages spoken in much of sub saharan africa the khoisan languages number about five zero and are spoken in southern africa by approximately one two zero zero zero zero people many of the khoisan languages are endangered the khoi and san peoples are considered the original inhabitants of this part of africa with a few notable exceptions in east africa nearly all african countries have adopted official languages that originated outside the continent and spread through colonialism or human migration for example in numerous countries english and french are used for communication in the public sphere such as government commerce education and the media arabic portuguese afrikaans and malagasy are other examples of originally non african languages that are used by millions of africans today both in the public and private spheres culture africa has a number of overlapping cultures the most conventional distinction is that between sub saharan africa and the northern countries from egypt to morocco who largely associate themselves with arabic culture in this comparison the nations to the south of the sahara are considered to consist of many cultural areas in particular that of the bantu linguistic group divisions may also be made between francophone africa and the rest of africa in particular the former british colonies of southern and east africa another cultural fault line is that between those africans living traditional lifestyles and those who are essentially modern the traditionalists are sometimes subdivided into pastoralists and agriculturalists african art reflects the diversity of african cultures the oldest existing art from africa are six zero zero zero year old carvings found in niger while the great pyramid of giza in egypt was the world s tallest architectural accomplishment for four thousand years until the creation of the eiffel tower the ethiopian complex of monolithic churches at lalibela of which the church of st george is representative is regarded as another marvel of engineering the music of africa is one of its most dynamic art forms egypt has long been a cultural focus of the arab world while remembrance of the rhythms of sub saharan africa in particular west africa was transmitted through the atlantic slave trade to modern blues jazz reggae rap and rock and roll modern music of the continent includes the highly complex choral singing of southern africa and the dance rhythms of soukous dominated by the music of the democratic republic of congo a recent development of the two one st century is the emergence of african hip hop in particular a form from senegal is blended with traditional mbalax recently in south africa a form of music related to house music known under the name kwaito has developed although the country has been home to its own form of south african jazz for some time while afrikaans music is completely distinct and comprised mostly of traditional boere musiek and forms of folk and rock list of african musicians list of african writers african cinema afrology religion africans profess a wide variety of religious beliefs with christianity and islam being the most widespread approximately four zero of all africans are christians and another four zero muslims roughly two zero of africans primarily follow indigenous african religions a small number of africans also have beliefs from the judaic tradition such as the beta israel and lemba tribes the indigenous african religions tend to revolve around animism and ancestor worship a common thread in traditional belief systems was the division of the spiritual world into helpful and harmful helpful spirits are usually deemed to include ancestor spirits that help their descendants and powerful spirits that protected entire communities from natural disaster or attacks from enemies whereas harmful spirits include the souls of murdered victims who were buried without the proper funeral rites and spirits used by hostile spirit mediums to cause illness among their enemies while the effect of these early forms of worship continues to have a profound influence belief systems have evolved as they interact with other religions the formation of the old kingdom of egypt in the third millennium bce marked the first known complex religious system on the continent around the ninth century bce carthage in present day tunisia was founded by the phoenicians and went on to become a major cosmopolitan center where deities from neighboring egypt rome and the etruscan city states were worshipped the ethiopian orthodox church officially dates from the fourth century and is thus one of the first established christian churches anywhere at first christian orthodoxy made gains in modern day sudan and other neighbouring regions however following the spread of islam growth was slow and restricted to the highlands islam entered africa as muslims conquered north africa between six four zero and seven one zero beginning with egypt they established mogadishu melinde mombasa kilwa and sofala following the sea trade down the coast of east africa and diffusing through the sahara desert into the interior of africa following in particular the paths of muslim traders muslims were also among the asian peoples who later settled in british ruled africa many africans were converted to west european forms of christianity during the colonial period in the last decades of the twentieth century various sects of charismatic christianity rapidly grew a number of roman catholic african bishops were even mentioned as possible papal candidates in two zero zero five african christians appear to be more socially conservative than their co religionists in much of the industrialized world which has quite recently led to tensions

animexample two gif this animation moves at two frames per second at this rate the individual frames should be discernible image animhorse gif one two frames per second is the typical rate for an animated cartoon animation is the illusion of motion created by the consecutive display of images of static elements in film and video production this refers to techniques by which each frame of a film or movie is produced individually these frames may be generated by computers or by photographing a drawn or painted image or by repeatedly making small changes to a model unit see claymation and stop motion and then photographing the result with a special animation camera when the frames are strung together and the resulting film is viewed there is an illusion of continuous movement due to the phenomenon known as persistence of vision generating such a film tends to be very labour intensive and tedious though the development of computer animation has greatly sped up the process graphics file formats like gif mng svg and flash swf allow animation to be viewed on a computer or over the internet the animations shown before consist of these six frames toc animation techniques traditional animation began with each frame being painted and then filmed cel animation developed by bray and hurd in the one nine one zero s sped up the process by using transparent overlays so that characters could be moved without the need to repaint the background for every frame more recently styles of animation based on painting and drawing have evolved such as the minimalist simpsons cartoons or the roughly sketched the snowman computer animation has advanced rapidly and is now approaching the point where movies can be created with characters so lifelike as to be hard to distinguish from real actors this involved a move from two d to three d the difference being that in two d animation the effect of perspective is created artistically but in three d objects are modeled in an internal three d representation within the computer and are then lit and shot from chosen angles just as in real life before being rendered to a two d bitmapped frame predictions that famous dead actors might even be brought back to life to play in new movies before long have led to speculation about the moral and copyright issues involved the use of computer animation as a way of achieving the otherwise impossible in conventionally shot movies has led to the term computer generated imagery being used though the term has become hard to distinguish from computer animation as it is now used in referring to three d movies that are entirely animated computer animation involves modelling motion generation followed by the addition of surfaces and then rendering surfaces are programmed to stretch and bend automatically in response to movements of a wire frame model and the final rendering converts such movements to a bitmap image it is the recent developments in rendering complex surfaces like fur and clothing textures that have enabled stunningly life like character models including surfaces that even ripple fold and blow in the wind with every fibre or hair individually calculated for rendering however that actually has little to do with the animation itself animation is the process of bringing a lifeless puppet to life through the use of motion many people confuse fancy effects and high res textures with animation but in fact life like motion can be created using the simplest of models pixar s work is a testament to this the goal of an animator is not simply to copy the real world but to enhance and to take the essence of the motion that is there and this is how animation can be elevated to the level of art there is a large misconception in the public mind that computers create animation today this couldn t be further from the truth a computer is nothing more though also nothing less than a very expensive fancy pencil and has to be treated as such for any quality work to be acheived the choices a computer makes when interpolating motion are almost always the wrong ones because the computer does not know what you are trying to create even if a complex physics system were created complete enough to exactly mimic the real world the end result would not be the desirable one because a large part of animation concerns the choices an animator makes when a computer tries to make the choices for you disaster is the general result history the major use of animation has always been for entertainment however there is growing use of instructional animation and educational animation to support explanation and learning the classic form of animation the animated cartoon as developed in the early one nine zero zero s and refined by ub iwerks walt disney and others requires up to two four distinct drawings for one second of animation this technique is described in detail in the article traditional animation because animation is very time consuming and often very expensive to produce the majority of animation for tv and movies comes from professional animation studios however the field of independent animation has existed at least since the one nine five zero s with animation being produced by independent studios and sometimes by a single person several independent animation producers have gone on to enter the professional animation industry bill plympton is one of the most well known independent animators today limited animation is a way of increasing production and decreasing costs of animation by using short cuts in the animation process this method was pioneered by upa and popularized some say exploited by hanna barbera and adapted by other studios as cartoons moved from movie theaters to television animation studios animation studios like movie studios may be production facilities or financial entities in some cases especially in anime they have things in common with artists studios where a master or group of talented individuals oversee the

apollo greek ap ll n or apell n was a god of light healing and poetry apollo was the son of zeus and leto and the twin brother of artemis goddess of the hunt as the prophetic deity of the delphic oracle apollo was one of the most important and many sided of the olympian deities in etruscan mythology he was known as aplu in later times apollo became partly confused or equated with helios god of the sun and his sister similarly equated with selene god of the moon particularly in religious contexts however apollo and helios remained separate beings in literary and mythological texts domains and symbols apollo the son of zeus and the mortal leto apollo was considered to have dominion over disease beauty light healing colonists medicine archery poetry prophecy dance reason intellectualism and shamans and was the patron defender of herds and flocks apollo s most common attributes were the lyre and the bow other attributes of his included the kithara an advanced version of the common lyre and plectrum another common emblem was the sacrificial tripod representing his prophetic powers the pythian games were held in apollo s honor every four years at delphi the laurel bay plant was used in expiatory sacrifices and in making the crown of victory at these games the palm tree was also sacred to apollo because he had been born under one in delos animals sacred to apollo included wolves dolphins and roe swans and grasshoppers symbolizing music and song hawks ravens crows and snakes referencing apollo s function as the god of prophecy mice and griffins mythical eagle lion hybrids of eastern origin as god of colonization apollo gave guidance on colonies especially during the height of colonization seven five zero five five zero bc according to greek tradition he helped cretan or arcadian colonists find the city of troy however this story may reflect a cultural influence which had the reverse direction hittite cuneiform texts mention a minor asian god called appaliunas or apalunas in connection with the city of wilusa which is now regarded as being identical with the greek illios by most scholars in this interpretation apollo s title of lykegenes can simply be read as born in lycia which effectively severs the god s supposed link with wolves possibly a folk etymology apollo popularly e g in literary criticism represents harmony order and reasons characteristics contrasted with those of dionysus god of wine who popularly represents emotion and disorder the contrast between the roles of these gods is reflected in the adjectives apollonian and dionysian however the greeks thought of the two qualities as complementary the two gods are brothers and when apollo at winter left for hyperborea he would leave the delphi oracle to dionysus worship apollo had a famous oracle in delphi and other notable ones in clarus and branchidae apollo is known as the leader of the muses musagetes and director of their choir hymns sung to apollo were called paeans the roman worship of apollo was adopted from the greeks there is a tradition that the delphic oracle was consulted as early as the period of the kings during the reign of tarquinius superbus in four three zero a temple was dedicated to apollo on the occasion of a pestilence during the second punic war in two one two the ludi apollinares were instituted in his honor in the time of augustus who considered himself under the special protection of apollo and was even said to be his son his worship developed and he became one of the chief gods of rome after the battle of actium augustus enlarged his old temple dedicated a portion of the spoils to him and instituted quinquennial games in his honour he also erected a new temple on the palatine hill and transferred the secular games for which horace composed his carmen saeculare to apollo and diana the chief festivals held in honour of apollo were the carneia daphnephoria delia hyacinthia pyanepsia pythia and thargelia the ludi apollinares were solemn games held to honor him the worship of apollo has returned with the rise of revivalist hellenic polytheism and the contemporary pagan movement one example of this revival is the group kyklos apollon also together with athena apollo under the name phevos was controversially designated as a mascot of the two zero zero four summer olympics in athens etymology the name apollo might have been derived from a pre hellenic compound apo ollon likely related to an archaic verb apo ell and literally meaning he who elbows off that is the dispelling one indeed he seems to have personified dispelling power which would relate to his association with the darkness dispelling power of the morning sun and the conceived power of reason and prophecy to dispel doubt and ignorance in addition the apparent expelling character of city walls and doorways as bulwarks against trespassers the people dispelling nature of disembarkations and expatriations to colonies the disease dispelling character of healing the predator dispelling character of a shepherd tending his flocks the pest dispelling nature of a farmer growing crops the power of music and the arts to dispel discord and barbary the highly important power of fit and skilled young men to dispel intruders and invading armies the ability of foresight into the future an explanation given by plutarch in moralia is that apollon signified a unity since pollon meant many and the prefix a was a negative thus apollon could be read as meaning deprived of multitude apollo was consequently associated with the monad hesychius connects the name apollo with the doric which means assembly so that apollo would be the god of political life and he also gives the explanation fold in which case apollo would be the god of flocks and herds apollo with a radiant halo in a roman floor mosaic el djem tunisia lare two nd century apollo in art in art apollo is usually depicted as a handsome beardless young man and often with a lyre or bow in hand in the late two nd century floor mosaic from el djem roman thysdrus illustration right he is identifiable as apollo helios by his effulgent halo though now even a god s divine nakedness is concealed by his cloak a mark of increasing conventions of modesty in the later empire anther haloed apollo in mosaic from hadrumentum is in the museum at sousse the conventions of this representation head tilted lips slightly parted large eyed curling hair cut in locks grazing the neck were developed in the three rd century bce to depict alexander the great bieber one nine six four yalouris one nine eight zero some time after this mosaic was executed the earliest depictions of christ will be beardless and haloed appellations epithets applied to apollo include phoebus shining one for apollo in the context of the god of light smintheus mouse catcher and parnopius grasshopper as god of the plague and defender against rats and locusts delphinios delphinian meaning of the womb associating apollo with delphoi delphi an aitiology in the homeric hymns connects the epitheton to dolphins archegetes director of the foundation for colonies musagetes leader of the muses pythios pythian at delphi apotropaeus he who averts evil nymphegetes nymph leader lyceios and lykegenes wolfish or of lycia where some postulate his cult originated nomios wandering as the pastoral shepherd god klarios from doric klaros allotment of land for his supervision over cities and colonies kynthios is another epithet stemming from his birth on mt cynthus loxias the obscure as apollo a god of prophecy specifically argurotoxos with the silver bow for archery aphetoros god of the bow for archery alexikakos restrainer of evil as apollo the healer akesios or iatros healer birth when hera discovered that leto was pregnant and that hera s husband zeus was the father she banned leto from giving birth on terra firma or the mainland or any island at sea in her wanderings leto found the newly created floating island of delos which was neither mainland nor a real island and gave birth there the island was surrounded by swans afterwards zeus secured delos to the bottom of the ocean this island later became sacred to apollo alternatively hera kidnapped ilithyia the goddess of childbirth to prevent leto from going into labor the other gods tricked hera into letting her go by offering her a necklace nine yards long of amber either way artemis was born first and then assisted with the birth of apollo another version states that artemis was born one day before apollo on the island of ortygia and that she helped leto cross the sea to delos the next day to give birth to apollo apollo was born on the seven th day of the month thargelion according to delian tradition or of the month bysios according to delphian tradition the seven th and two zero th the days of the new and full moon were ever afterwards held sacred to him youth in his youth apollo killed the vicious dragon python which lived in delphi beside the castalian spring according to some because python had attempted to rape leto while she was pregnant with apollo and artemis this was the spring which emitted vapors that caused the oracle at delphi to give her prophesies apollo killed python but had to be punished for it since python was a child of gaia apollo and admetus when zeus struck down apollo s son asclepius with a lightning bolt for resurrecting the dead and thus stealing hades s subjects apollo in revenge killed the cyclops who had fashioned the bolt for zeus apollo would have been banished to tartarus forever but was instead sentenced to one year of hard labour as punishment thanks to the intercession of his mother leto during this time he served as shepherd for king admetus of pherae in thessaly admetus treated apollo well and in return the god conferred great benefits on admetus apollo helped admetus win alcestis the daughtor of king pelias and later convinced the fates to let admetus live past his time if another took his place but when it came time for admetus to die his elderly parents whom he had assumed would gladly die for him refused to cooperate instead alcestis took his place but heracles managed to persuade thanatos the god of death to return her to the world of the living apollo during the trojan war apollo shot arrows infected with the plague into the greek encampment during the trojan war in rage because the greeks had kidnapped chryseis the daughter of apollo s priest he demanded her return and the greeks eventually complied when diomedes injured aeneas during the trojan war apollo rescued him first aphrodite tried to rescue aeneas but diomedes injured her as well aeneas was then enveloped in a cloud by apollo who took him to pergamos a sacred spot in troy artemis healed aeneas there apollo had aided paris in the killing of achilles if paris did not accomplish the task himself niobe a queen of thebes and wife of amphion niobe boasted of her superiority to leto because she had fourteen children niobids seven male and seven female while leto had only two apollo killed her sons as they practiced athletics with the last begging for his life and artemis her daughters apollo and artemis used poisoned arrows to kill them though according to some versions of the myth a number of the niobids were spared chloris usually amphion at the sight of his dead sons either killed himself or was killed by apollo after swearing revenge a devastated niobe fled to mt siplyon in asia minor and turned into stone as she wept her tears formed the river achelous zeus had turned all the people of thebes to stone and so no one buried the niobids until the ninth day after their death when the gods themselves entombed them apollo s romantic life and children female lovers apollo chased the nymph daphne daughter of peneus who had scorned him his infatuation was caused by an arrow from eros who was jealous because apollo had made fun of his archery skills eros also claimed to be irritated by apollo s singing simultaneously however eros had shot a hate arrow into daphne causing her to be repulsed by apollo following a spirited chase by apollo daphne prayed to mother earth alternatively her father a river god to help her and he changed her into a laurel tree which became sacred to apollo apollo had an affair with a mortal princess named leucothea daughter of orchamus and sister of clytia leucothea loved apollo who disguised himself as leucothea s mother to gain entrance to her chambers clytia jealous of her sister because she wanted apollo for herself told orchamus the truth betraying her sister s trust and confidence in her enraged orchamus ordered leucothea to be buried alive apollo refused to forgive clytia for betraying his beloved and a grieving clytia wilted and slowly died apollo changed her into an incense plant either heliotrope or sunflower which follows the sun every day marpessa was kidnapped by idas but was loved by apollo as well zeus made her choose between them and she chose idas on the grounds that apollo being immortal would tire of her when she grew old castalia was a nymph whom apollo loved she fled from him and dived into the spring at delphi at the base of mt parnassos which was then named after her water from this spring was sacred it was used to clean the delphian temples and inspire poets by cyrene apollo had a son named aristaeus who became the patron god of cattle fruit trees hunting husbandry and bee keeping he was also a culture hero and taught humanity dairy skills and the use of nets and traps in hunting as well as how to cultivate olives with hecuba wife of king priam of troy apollo had a son named troilius an oracle prophesied that troy would not be defeated as long as troilius reached the age of twenty alive he and his sister polyxena were ambushed and killed by achilles apollo also fell in love with cassandra daughter of hecuba and priam and troilius half sister he promised cassandra the gift of prophecy to seduce her but she rejected him afterwards enraged apollo indeed gifted her with the ability to know the future with a curse that no one would ever believe her coronis daughter of phlegyas king of the lapiths was another of apollo s liaisons pregnant with asclepius coronis fell in love with ischys son of elatus a crow informed apollo of the affair when first informed he disbelieved the crow and turned all crows black where they were previously white as a punishment for speading untruths when he found out the truth he sent his sister artemis to kill coronis as a result he also made the crow sacred and gave them the task of announcing important deaths apollo rescued the baby and gave it to the centaur chiron to raise phlegyas was irate after the death of his daughter and burned the temple of apollo at delphi apollo then killed him for what he did male lovers apollo and hyacinthus jacopo caraglio one six th c italian engraving apollo the eternal beardless kouros himself had the most male lovers of all the greek gods that was to be expected from a god who was god of the palaestra the athletic gathering place for youth who all competed in the nude a god said to represent the ideal educator and therefore the ideal erastes or lover of a boy sergent p one zero two all his lovers were younger than him in the style of the greek pederastic relationships of the time many of apollo s young beloveds died accidentally a reflection on the function of these myths as part of rites of passage in which the youth died in order to be reborn as an adult hyacinth was one of his male lovers hyacinthus was a spartan prince beautiful and athletic the pair were practicing throwing the discus when hyacinthus was struck in the head by a discus blown off course by zephyrus who was jealous of apollo and loved hyacinthus as well when hyacinthus died apollo is said in some accounts to have been so filled with grief that he cursed his own immortality wishing to join his lover in mortal death out of the blood of his slain lover apollo created the hyacinth flower as a memorial to his death and his tears stained the flower petals with meaning alas the festival of hyacinthus was a celebration of sparta one of his other liaisons was with acantha the spirit of the acanthus tree upon his death he was transformed into a sun loving herb by apollo and his bereaved sister acanthis was turned into a thistle finch by the other gods another male lover was cyparissus a descendant of heracles apollo gave the boy a tame deer as a companion but cyparissus accidentally killed it with a javelin as it lay asleep in the undergrowth cyparissus asked apollo to let his tears fall forever apollo turned the sad boy into a cypress tree which was said to be a sad tree because the sap forms droplets like tears on the trunk apollo and the birth of hermes hermes was born on mount cyllene in arcadia the story is told in the homeric hymn to hermes his mother maia had been secretly impregnated by zeus in a secret affair maia wrapped the infant in blankets but hermes escaped while she was asleep hermes ran to thessaly where apollo was grazing his cattle the infant hermes stole a number of his cows and took them to a cave in the woods near pylos covering their tracks in the cave he found a tortoise and killed it then removed the insides he used one of the cow s intestines and the tortoise shell and made the first lyre apollo complained to maia that her son had stolen his cattle but hermes had already replaced himself in the blankets she had wrapped him in so maia refused to believe apollo s claim zeus intervened and claiming to have seen the events sided with apollo hermes then began to play music on the lyre he had invented apollo a god of music fell in love with the instrument and offered to allow exchange the cattle for the lyre hence apollo became a master of the lyre and hermes invented a kind of pipes instrument called a syrinx later apollo exchanged a caduceus for a syrinx from hermes other stories musical contests pan once pan had the audacity to compare his music with that of apollo and to challenge apollo the god of the lyre to a trial of skill tmolus the mountain god was chosen to umpire pan blew on his pipes and with his rustic melody gave great satisfaction to himself and his faithful follower midas who happened to be present then apollo struck the strings of his lyre tmolus at once awarded the victory to apollo and all but midas agreed with the judgment he dissented and questioned the justice of the award apollo would not suffer such a depraved pair of ears any longer and caused them to become the ears of a donkey marsyas the flaying of marsyas by titian c one five seven zero seven six marsyas was a satyr who challenged apollo to a contest of music he had found an aulos on the ground tossed away after being invented by athena because it made her cheeks puffy marsyas lost and was flayed alive in a cave near calaenae in phrygia for his hubris to challenge a god his blood turned into the river marsyas another variation is that apollo played his instrument the lyre upside down marsyas could not do this with his instrument the flute and so apollo hung him from a tree and flayed him alive taken from man myth who mourns for adonis a man claiming to be apollo is seen on a greek themed planet that captain kirk pavel chekov mr spock and dr mccoy arrive on in the battlestar galactica series one of the main characters is given the call sign of apollo the song cygnus x one book ii hemispheres by

still in a high chair when agassi started playing tennis his ball collection filled six zero garbage cans with three zero zero balls per can and agassi would hit three zero zero zero five zero zero zero balls every day when andre was five years old he was already practicing with pros such as jimmy connors and roscoe tanner mike agassi learned tennis by watching tapes of champions mike agassi took a very systematic approach to the physics and psychology of tennis and still remains active in the sport more information can be found in mike agassi s book the agassi story at age of one four andre was shipped off to teaching guru nick bollettieri s tennis academy in florida he turned professional when he was one six tennis career one nine eight six one nine nine seven agassi turned professional in one nine eight six and won his first top level singles title in one nine eight seven at itaparica he won six further tournaments in one nine eight eight and by december that year he had surpassed us two million in career prize money after playing in just four three tournaments the quickest player in history to do so as a young up and coming player agassi embraced a rebel image he grew his hair to rock star length sported an ear ring and wore colorful shirts that pushed tennis still strict sartorial boundaries he boasted of a cheeseburger heavy diet and endorsed the canon rebel camera image is everything was the ad s tag line and it became andre s as well strong performances on the tour meant that agassi was quickly tipped as a future grand slam champion but he began the one nine nine zero s with a series of near misses he reached his first grand slam final in one nine nine zero at the french open where he lost in four sets to the seasoned veteran player andr s g mez later that year he lost in the final of the us open to another up and coming teenaged star pete sampras the rivalry between these two american players was to become the dominant rivalry in tennis over the rest the of the decade in one nine nine one agassi reached his second consecutive french open final where he faced his former bollettieri academy mate jim courier courier emerged the victor in a dramatic rain interrupted five set final agassi chose not to play at wimbledon from one nine eight eight nine zero and publicly stated that he did not wish to play there because of the event s traditionalism particularly its predominantly white dress code which players at the event are required to conform to many observers at the time speculated that agassi s real motivation was that his strong baseline game would not be well suited to wimbledon s grass court surface agassi decided to play at wimbledon in one nine nine one leading to weeks of speculation in the media about what he would wear he eventually emerged for the first round in a completely white outfit he reached the quarter finals on that occasion to the surprise of many agassi s grand slam breakthrough came at wimbledon in one nine nine two when he beat goran ivani evi in a tight five set final following wrist surgery in one nine nine three agassi came back strongly in one nine nine four and captured the us

in straight sets in the final he also repeated at the cincinnati masters and the miami masters one nine nine seven was a poor year for agassi he won no top level titles and his ranking sank to world no one four one in november his form was perhaps affected by the intense publicity surrounding his high profile and turbulent relationship and marriage to actress brooke shields one nine nine eight two zero zero four in one nine nine eight agassi rededicated himself to tennis he shaved his balding head began a rigorous conditioning program and worked his way back up the rankings by playing in challenger series tournaments a circuit for professional players ranked outside the world s top five zero perhaps most remarkably the one time rebel emerged as a gracious and thoughtful athlete looked up to by younger players after winning matches he took to bowing and blowing a two handed kisses to spectators on each side of the court a gesture seen as a rather humble acknowledgment of their support for him and for tennis in one nine nine eight agassi won five titles and leapt from no one two two on the rankings at the start of the year to no six at the end of it making it the highest jump into the top one zero made by any player in tennis he won five titles in ten finals and finished runner up at the miami masters agassi entered the history books in one nine nine nine when he beat

since rod laver achieved the grand slam in one nine six nine two zero zero zero also saw agassi reach the semi finals at wimbledon where he lost in five sets to patrick rafter in a very high quality

three six three in the semifinals to end the russian s hopes to become the youngest world no one in the history of tennis agassi eventually lost to gustavo kuerten six four six four six four this loss

coria in a tough battle at the two zero zero five french open agassi lost to jarkko nieminem in their first round match after enduring back pain related to a pinched sciatic nerve he lost in five sets with six zero in the fifth after much media speculation about retirement the three five year old agassi won in los angeles and made the final at montreal before falling to world no two rafael nadal in

seven six seven four tom berdych three six six one six four seven six seven two and xavier malisse six three six four six seven five seven four six six two his quarterfinal match against fellow american james blake has been called one of the best matches in us open history after dropping the first two sets three six three six agassi took the next two six three six three in the fifth set blake served for the match at five four but agassi broke his serve then won the tiebreak eight six to secure the victory at one one five a m he defeated robby ginepri another rising talented american with a consistent baseline game in his third consecutive five set match to earn a spot in the final against world no one roger federer after losing the first set six three agassi broke federer twice to win the second six two he broke federer again and at this point looked to be the better player agassi had a three zero love lead but with a few costly errors was broken to force a tiebreak which federer took seven one andre ran out of gas which allowed federer to reel off five straight games being down five zero in the fourth set agassi held to make it five one before federer closed it out to win the championship after the match agassi thanked new york for the two zero years of memories hinting at potential retirement however agassi has made clear that he will only retire on his terms when he feels that he cannot perform at his best on the court he will likely continue for another year as he has qualified for the two zero zero five masters cup which is limited to the eight best players in the world and is scheduled to play the lead in tournament to the two zero zero six australian open coming into the two zero zero five masters cup agassi is two nine five on hard courts with his

to close out the winter hardcourt season agassi has officially said that he is skipping the entire clay season since it burdens his body he will do his best to be ready for wimbledon however agassi s top priority in two zero zero six will once again be making yet another run at the us open in august expect all scheduling decisons to be made with that goal in mind playing style agassi employs a baseline style of play but unlike most such players he typically makes contact with the ball inside the baseline exceptionally difficult even for professionals this is possible because of his short backswing which also helps him return fast serves he is also blessed with the best hand and eye coordination rivaled only by roger federer john mcenroe and others have called agassi the best service returner ever to play professional tennis after agassi s rededication to tennis in one nine nine eight he has focused more on physical conditioning than in the past and is now one of the fittest players on the tour his upper body strength allows him to bench press three five zero lbs he has remarkable endurance and rarely appears tired on court as long as he is not injured he handles long grueling matches arguably better than any other player on the tour even roger federer has been known to tire by the fifth set indeed agassi is often ready to start the next point when his opponent is catching his breath one of his strategies is to wear down his opponents continually putting pressure on them by returning the ball early and deep at angles agassi will try to stand in nearly one spot and hit the corners to make his opponent scramble he will often pass up the winner and hit a slightly less aggressive shot to make his opponent run a little more to retrieve a few more shots his penchant for running players around point after point has earned him the nickname the punisher agassi s biggest weakness currently is his lack of consistent speed and players who are able to consistently hit at sharp angles with pace give him trouble agassi used to be one of the fastest players on tour however his recent injuries have forced him to consistently run his fastest selectively usually in grand slams and tennis masters series events to make up for this recently adopted weakness agassi generally keeps his opponent on the defense federer is the only player with a long winning streak against agassi even sampras lost to agassi many times personal and family life after a four year courtship agassi married actress brooke shields in a lavish ceremony on april one nine one nine nine seven that february they had filed suit against the national enquirer claiming it printed false and fabricated statements brooke was undergoing counseling binge eating and taking pills agassi

pancho gonzales in one nine nine five when gonzales died in las vegas andre paid for his brother in law s funeral andre has participated in many charity organizations and founded the andre agassi charitable association which assists the youth of las vegas in one nine nine five he has won one nine nine five s atp arthur ashe s humanitarian award in recognition of his efforts helping disadvantaged youth in la the andre agassi charitable foundation has always and will continue to fund organizations which offer programs that consistently carry out the mission of the foundation the foundation s mission is to provide educational and recreational institutions and activities for abandoned abused and at risk kids the following organizations are fine examples the andre agassi boys claim agassi by both the armenian and iranian communities in the united states and abroad agassi has often seemed somewhat ambivalent for example joking after his all armenian match against sargis sargsian at the us open in two zero zero four well i m only half armenian though he agreed to appear in a pbs documentary about armenian americans his father has written in his book the agassi story about his experience of being an outsider in muslim iran but andre has also shown interest in the iranian aspect of his heritage in february two zero zero five expressing a desire to visit iran which holds a special place in his heart quotes about pete sampras retirement you grow up with a guy you compete against him for so long he s such a big part of your career something that s pretty special so you do have that sense of personal regret that he s not around any more you miss having that around during the two zero zero five us open i ve been motivated by overcoming challenge and overcoming the hurdles and obstacles that face me there still is plenty out there to get motivated by from mats wilander asked to name the top five tennis players of all time he placed agassi sampras federer and borg in the top four in no order and tied mcenroe lendl and connors for fifth place on agassi he has some limitations like he can t serve and volley yet he has won all four slams he has a very high energy level quite like borg he is on fifth gear from the very first point there is some abnormality in his eyes otherwise he wouldn t have had such a phenomenal return he sees the ball like none else and just guides it wherever he wants to he s just played a grand slam final at three five that tells me he wasted the first five years of his career otherwise he couldn t have lasted this long no one

asiatic languages are a large language family of southeast asia and india the name comes from the greek words for south asia among these languages only vietnamese khmer and mon have a long recorded history and only vietnamese and khmer have official status in vietnam and cambodia respectively the rest of the languages are spoken by minority groups austroasiatic languages have a disjunct distribution across india and southeast asia separated by regions where other languages are spoken it is widely believed that the austroasiatic languages are the autochthonous languages of southeast asia and eastern india and that the other languages of the region including the indo european tai kadai and sino tibetan languages are the result of later migrations of people there are for example austroasiatic words in the tibeto burman languages of eastern nepal some linguists have attempted to prove that austroasiatic languages are related to austronesian languages thus forming the austric superfamily linguists traditionally recognize two major divisions of austroasiatic the mon khmer languages of southeast asia and the munda languages of east central and central india ethnologue identifies one six eight austroasiatic languages of which one four seven are mon khmer languages and two one are munda languages however no evidence for this classification has ever been published and it remains speculative each of the subdivisions of the classification below that is written in boldface type is accepted as a valid family however the relationships between these families within austroasiatic is debated it should be noted that little of the data used for competing classifications has ever been published and therefore cannot be evaluated by peer review the classification used here is that of diffloth in press which does not accept traditional mon khmer as a valid unit munda languages india koraput seven languages core munda languages kharian juang two languages north munda

languages egyptian languages semitic languages cushitic languages beja language subclassification controversial widely classified as part of cushitic omotic languages controversial sometimes argued to be outside afro asiatic the ongota language is often considered afro asiatic but its classification within the family remains controversial partly for lack of data harold fleming tentatively suggests that it is an independent branch of non omotic afro asiatic it is not generally agreed on where proto afro asiatic was spoken africa e g igor diakonoff lionel bender has often been suggested particularly ethiopia because it includes the majority of the diversity of the afro asiatic language family and has very diverse groups in close geographic proximity often considered a telltale sign for a linguistic geographic origin the western red sea coast and the sahara have also been put forward e g christopher ehret alexander militarev suggests that their homeland was in the levant specifically he identifies them with the natufian culture the semitic languages are the only afro asiatic subfamily based outside of africa however in historical or near historical times some semitic speakers crossed from south arabia back into ethiopia so some modern ethiopian languages such as amharic are semitic rather than belonging to the substrate cushitic or omotic groups a minority of

cushitic including beja and chadic classification history medieval scholars sometimes linked two or more branches of afro asiatic together already in the nine th century the hebrew grammarian judah ibn quraysh of tiaret algeria perceived a relationship between berber and semitic the latter being known to him through arabic hebrew and aramaic in the one eight zero zero s europeans began suggesting such relationships thus in one eight four four th benfey suggested a language family containing semitic berber and cushitic calling the latter ethiopic in the same year t n newman suggested a relationship between semitic and hausa but this would long remain a topic of dispute and uncertainty the traditional hamito semitic family was named by friedrich m ller in one eight seven six in his grundriss der sprachwissenschaft and defined as consisting of a semitic group plus a hamitic group containing egyptian berber and cushitic the chadic group was not included these classifications were partly based on non linguistic anthropological and racial arguments see also hamitic hypothesis leo reinisch one nine zero nine proposed to link cushitic and chadic while urging a more distant affinity with egyptian and semitic thus foreshadowing greenberg but his suggestion was largely ignored marcel cohen one nine two four rejected the idea of a distinct hamitic subgroup and included hausa a chadic language in his comparative hamito semitic vocabulary joseph greenberg one nine five zero strongly confirmed cohen s rejection of hamitic added and sub classified the chadic languages and proposed the new name afro asiatic for the family his classification of it came to be almost universally accepted in one nine six nine harold fleming proposed the recognition of omotic as a fifth branch rather than as previously believed a subgroup of cushitic and this has become generally accepted several scholars including harold fleming and robert hetzron have since questioned the traditional inclusion of beja in cushitic but this view has yet to gain general acceptance there is little agreement on the subclassification of the five or six branches mentioned however christopher ehret one nine seven nine harold fleming one nine eight one and joseph greenberg one nine eight one all agree that omotic was the first branch to split from the rest otherwise ehret groups egyptian berber and semitic together in a north afro asiatic subgroup paul newman one nine eight zero groups berber with chadic and egyptian with semitic while questioning the inclusion of omotic fleming one nine eight one divided non omotic afroasiatic or erythraean into three groups cushitic semitic and chadic berber egyptian he later added semitic and beja to the latter and proposed ongot as a tentative new third branch of erythraean lionel bender one nine nine seven advocates a macro cushitic consisting of berber cushitic and semitic while regarding chadic and omotic as the most remote

de andorra is a small landlocked principality in south western europe located in the eastern pyrenees mountains and bordered by france and spain once isolated it is currently a prosperous country mainly because of tourism and its status as a tax haven andorra is not to be confused with the comune di andora origin and history of the name the name andorra probably originates from a navarrese word andurrial which translates as shrub covered land history tradition holds that charlemagne granted a charter to the andorran people in return for their fighting the moors overlordship of the territory passed to the local count of urgell and eventually to the bishop of the diocese of urgell in the one one th century a dispute arose between the bishop and his northern french neighbour over andorra in one two seven eight the conflict was resolved by the signing of a parage which provided that andorra s sovereignty be shared between the french count of foix whose title would ultimately transfer to the french head of state and the bishop of la seu d urgell in catalonia this gave the small principality its territory and political form over the years the title passed to the kings of navarre after henry of navarre became king henry iv of france he issued an edict one six zero seven that established the head of the french state and the bishop of urgell as co princes of andorra in the period one eight one two one three the french empire annexed catalonia and divided it in four departments andorra was also annexed and made part of the district of puigcerd d partement of s gre in one nine three three france occupied andorra as a result of social unrest before elections on july one two one nine three four an adventurer named boris skossyreff issued a proclamation in urgel declaring himself boris i sovereign prince of andorra simultaneously declaring war on the bishop of urgel he was arrested by spanish authorities on july two zero and ultimately expelled from spain from one nine three six to one nine four zero a french detachment was garrisoned in andorra to prevent influences of the spanish civil war and franco s spain the franco troops reached the andorran border in the later stages of the war during the second world war andorra remained neutral and was an important smuggling route between vichy france and spain in one nine five eight andorra declared peace with germany having been forgotten on the treaty of versailles that ended the first world war and remaining legally at war given its relative isolation andorra has existed outside the mainstream of european history with few ties to countries other than france and spain in recent times however its thriving tourist industry along with developments in transportation and communications have removed the country from its isolation and its political system was thoroughly modernized in one nine nine three the year in which it finally became a member of the united nations politics until very recently andorra s political system had no clear division of powers into executive legislative and judicial branches ratified and approved in one nine nine three the constitution establishes andorra as a sovereign parliamentary democracy that retains the co princes as heads of state but the head of government retains executive power the two co princes serve coequally with limited powers that do not include veto over government acts they are represented in andorra by a delegate the way in which the two princes are chosen makes andorra one of the most politically distinct nations on earth one co prince is the man or woman who is currently serving as president of france currently jacques chirac it has historically been any head of state of france including kings and emperors of france the other is the current catholic bishop of the catalan city of la seu d urgell currently joan enric vives i sicilia as neither prince lives in andorra their role is almost entirely ceremonial andorra s main legislative body is the unicameral general council of the valleys consell general de les valls a parliament of two eight seats members are elected by direct popular vote one four from a single national constituency and one four to represent each of the seven parishes with members serving four year terms the andorran government is formed by the general council electing the head of government cap de govern who then appoints ministers to the cabinet the executive council govern currently government is held by the liberal party of andorra with albert pintat as prime minister the social

shape that combine into one as the main stream the valira river leaves the country for spain at andorra s lowest point of eight seven zero m andorra s climate is similar to its neighbours temperate climate but its higher altitude means there is on average more snow in winter and it is slightly cooler in summer economy andorra la vella tourism the mainstay of andorra s tiny well to do economy accounts for roughly eight zero of gdp an estimated nine million tourists visit annually attracted by andorra s duty free status and by its summer and winter resorts andorra s comparative advantage has recently eroded as the economies of adjoining france and spain have been opened up providing broader availability of goods and lower tariffs the banking sector with its tax haven status also contributes substantially to the economy agricultural production is limited only two of the land is arable and most food has to be imported the principal livestock activity is domestic sheep raising manufacturing output consists mainly of cigarettes cigars and furniture andorra is not a full member of the european union but enjoys a special relationship with it such as being treated as an eu member for trade in manufactured goods no tariffs and as a non eu member for agricultural products andorra lacks a currency of its own and uses that of its two surrounding nations prior to one nine nine nine these were the french franc and the spanish peseta which have since been replaced by a single currency the euro unlike other small european states that use the euro andorra does not yet mint its own euro coins in october two zero zero four negotiations between andorra and the eu began on an agreement which would allow andorra to mint its own coins andorra s natural resources include hydropower mineral water timber iron ore and lead demographics andorrans constitute a minority in their own country only three three of inhabitants hold andorran nationality the largest group of foreign nationals is that of spaniards four three with portuguese one one and french seven nationals the other main groups the remaining six belong to several other nationalities the only official language is catalan the language of the nearby spanish autonomous region of catalonia with which andorra shares many cultural traits though spanish portuguese and french are also commonly spoken the predominant religion is roman catholicism culture andorra s long history has provided it with a rich mythology and an abundance of folk tales with roots originating in as far as andalusia in the south

set is used perhaps somewhat loosely for example the number three eight could occur more than once in such a set if one particular number occurs more times than others in the set it is called a mode the arithmetic mean is what pupils are taught very early to call the average if the set is a statistical population then we speak of the population mean if the set is a statistical sample we call the resulting statistic a sample mean when the mean is not an accurate estimate of the median the set of numbers or frequency distribution is said to be skewed the symbol greek mu is used to denote the arithmetic mean of a population if we denote a set of data by x then the sample mean is typically denoted with a horizontal bar over the variable x generally enunciated x bar in practice the difference between and x is that is typically unobservable because one observes only a sample rather than the whole population and if the sample is drawn randomly then one may treat x but not as a random variable attributing a probability distribution to it both are computed in the same way mathrm bar x one cdots x n n the arithmetic mean is greatly influenced by outliers for instance reporting the average net worth in redmond washington as the arithmetic mean of all annual net worths would yield a surprisingly high number because of bill gates these distortions occur when the mean is different from the median and the median is a superior alternative when that happens in certain situations the arithmetic mean is the wrong concept of average altogether for example if a stock rose one zero in the first year three zero in the second year and fell one zero in the third year then it would be incorrect to report its average increase per year over this three year period as the arithmetic mean one zero three zero one zero three one zero the correct average in this case is the geometric mean which yields an average increase per year of only eight eight if x is a random variable then the expected value of x can be seen as the long term arithmetic mean that occurs on repeated measurements of x this is the content of the law of large numbers as a result the sample mean is used to estimate unknown expected values note that several other means have been defined including the generalized mean the generalized f mean the harmonic mean the arithmetic geometric mean and the weighted mean alternate notations the arithmetic mean may also be expressed using the sum notation bar frac one n sum n x i see also mean average summary statistics variance central tendency

afc along with the one zero former afl teams all of the other nfl teams formed the national football conference nfc initially this alignment proved to be very unpopular with fans in these cities the afc logo shown to the right is a variation of the old afl logo as seen here introduced in one nine seven zero alongside the beginning of the new afc the logo has basically remained unchanged since its introduction though the a wasn t as bold when it was first introduced the afc currently consists of one six teams organized into four divisions north south east and west of four teams each each team plays the other teams in their division twice home and away during the regular season in addition to one zero other games teams assigned to their schedule by the nfl the previous may two of these games are assigned on the basis of the team s final record in the previous season the remaining eight games are split between the roster of two other nfl divisions this assignment shifts each year for instance in the two zero zero six regular season each team in the afc east will play a game apiece against each team in both the afc south and the nfc north in this way division competition consists of common opponents with the exception of the two games assigned on the strength of each team s prior season record the nfc operates according to the same system at the end of each football season there are playoff games involving the top six teams in the afc the four division champions by place standing and the top two remaining non division champion teams wild cards by record the last two teams remaining play in the afc championship game with the winner receiving the lamar hunt trophy the afc champion plays the nfc champion in the super bowl national football league there have been two united states politicians named albert arnold gore the father albert gore sr was a senator from tennessee from one nine five three to one nine seven one the son albert gore jr often called simply al gore was both a representative and a senator from tennessee and was both a u s vice president and a presidential candidate this article is about the former united states vice president for his father see albert gore sr albert arnold gore jr born march three one one nine four eight is an american politician and businessman who served as the four five th vice president of the united states from one nine nine three to two zero zero one he ran for president in two zero zero zero following bill clinton s two four year terms he was defeated in the electoral college vote by the republican candidate george w bush on a vote of two seven one two six six with a gore committed elector from washington dc abstaining however gore did receive more individual votes than bush the election was bitterly contested including multiple recounts and a five four supreme court decision that effectively secured the election for president george w bush gore currently serves as president of the american television channel current and chairman of generation investment management sits on the board of directors of apple computer and serves as an unofficial advisor to google s senior management although speculation about a possible presidential run in two zero zero eight still continues he has stated that he does not currently plan to return to politics but doesn t rule this possibility out in the future early life he attended the sheridan school and later the elite st albans school in one nine six five gore enrolled at harvard college where he majored in government his roommates in dunster house were actor tommy lee jones and former columbia university women s basketball star katie day s father bart day gore graduated from harvard in june one nine six nine with a bachelor of arts degree

late two zero zero five bought a condo at san francisco s swanky st regis soldier and journalist gore served as a field reporter in vietnam for four months although opposed to the vietnam war on august seven one nine six nine gore enlisted in the army to participate in the vietnam war effort after completing training as a military journalist gore shipped to vietnam in early one nine seven one serving for four months before being given an honorable discharge the chronology of gore s military service is as follows august one nine six nine enlisted at the newark new jersey recruiting office august to october one nine six nine eight weeks of basic training at fort dix new jersey late october one nine six nine to december one nine seven zero fort rucker alabama on the job occupational training at the army flier newspaper january one nine seven one to may one nine seven one field reporter in vietnam part of the two zero th engineer brigade stationed primarily at bien hoa air base near saigon may two four one nine seven one given an honorable discharge after his early discharge request was granted gore stated many times that he opposed the vietnam war but chose to enlist anyway some observers have noted that gore could have avoided vietnam in a number of ways gore considered all these options but said that his sense of civic duty compelled him to serve alexander cockburn and jeffrey st clair suggest in al gore a user s manual that gore joined the military for political gain because gore served as a journalist he was never exposed to front line combat although some allege that his famous father s influence helped him to obtain this position most military analysts agree that any man who enlisted with a harvard degree had a good chance of being assigned a support specialty rather than an infantry position even at the war s height eight eight of all servicemen were assigned to noncombatant specialties however gore s decision to enlist for a two year term did mean that he would not be able to select his assignment a choice which was available to three year enlistees according to newsweek journalist bill turque s biography inventing al gore which does not shy away from criticism and scandals such as charging gore with smoking marijuana far more frequently than he admits dess stokes staff sergeant at the newark armed forces entrance and examination station on the day he walked in doesn t remember any communication from superiors about gore a kid with gore s background a one three four iq and a harvard degree he said didn t need to be a senator s son with high level contacts to get the military job he wanted gore s father al gore sr lost the one nine seven zero election and was no longer a senator by the time gore arrived in vietnam but was a senator until january one nine seven one which included the time his son would have received his assignment some critics charge that his father s stature led gore s superiors to give him less dangerous assignments than they might otherwise have given him according to combat photographer h alan leo gore was protected from dangerous situations at the request of brigadier general kenneth b cooper the two zero th engineer brigades commander leo stated that gore s trips into the field were safe and that gore could have worn a tuxedo these remarks seem to contradict gore s many public statements i carried an m one six i pulled my turn on the perimeter at night and walked through the elephant grass and i was fired upon baltimore sun i took my turn regularly on the perimeter in these little firebases out in the boonies something would move we d fire first and ask questions later vanity fair i was shot at i spent most of my time in the field washington post i used to fly these things combat helicopters with the doors open sitting on the ledge with our feet hanging down if you flew low and fast they wouldn t have as much time to shoot you weekly standard for his part gore has stated that he knew leo but rarely traveled with him in vietnam and that he never felt that he was being given special protection on the other hand leo s testimony is that cooper gave the orders before gore arrived so gore would not know about them the question of whether leo frequently traveled with gore or not still has not been conclusively answered turque s book however states that cooper said that he has no recollection of even meeting leo much less discussing gore s safety with him the evidence indicates that if there was an official effort to guarantee gore s safety it was uneven at best his clippings from the castle courier the newspaper of the u s army engineering command and other publications suggest that he pulled his weight which in his case meant choppering around to report features about the good works of the two zero th engineers when smith said he was scheduled to leave for r r in hawaii the sergeant called for volunteers gore stepped up and spent a cold night in a foxhole al did what everybody else did said mike o hara the photographer who shot the khe sanh assignment regulations allowed for early release of personnel to teach or attend school if their services were deemed not essential to the mission and gore certainly qualified gore stated in one nine eight eight that his experience in vietnam didn t change my conclusions about the war being a terrible mistake but it struck me that opponents to the war including myself really did not take into account the fact that there were an awful lot of south vietnamese who desperately wanted to hang on to what they called freedom coming face to face with those sentiments expressed by people who did the laundry and ran the restaurants and worked in the fields was something i was naively unprepared for after returning from vietnam gore spent five years as a reporter for the tennessean a newspaper headquartered in nashville tennessee during this time gore also attended vanderbilt divinity school and law school although he did not complete a degree at either congress al gore speaks during a congressional hearing in the one nine eight zero s in the spring of one nine seven six gore quit law school to run for the u s house in tennessee s fourth district gore defeated stanley rogers in the democratic primary then ran unopposed and was elected to his first congressional post he was re elected three times in one nine seven eight one nine eight zero and one nine eight two in one nine eight four gore did not run for the house instead he successfully ran for a seat in the senate which had been vacated by republican majority leader howard baker gore served as a senator from tennessee until one nine nine three when he became vice president house of representatives on march one nine one nine seven nine gore became the first person to appear on c span making a speech in the house chambers senate one nine eight eight presidential run in one nine eight eight gore ran for president but failed to obtain the democratic nomination which went instead to michael dukakis son s accident and effect on one nine nine two presidential run on april three one nine eight nine gore s six year old son albert was nearly killed in an automobile accident while leaving the baltimore orioles opening game because of this and the resulting lengthy healing process his father chose to stay near him during the recovery instead of laying the foundation for a presidential primary campaign against eventual nominee bill clinton gore started writing earth in the balance his book on environmental conservation during his son s recovery earth in the balance became the first book written by a sitting senator to make the new york times best seller list since john f kennedy s profiles in courage congressional committees while in congress gore was a member of the following committees armed services defense industry and technology projection forces and regional defense strategic forces and

clinton chose gore to be his running mate on july nine one nine nine two to the surprise of many as the two were both young and were from the same region of the nation after winning the one nine nine two election al gore was inaugurated as the four five th vice president of the united states on january two zero one nine nine three clinton and gore were re elected to a second term in the one nine nine six election during his time as vice president al gore was mostly a behind the scenes player however many experts consider him to be one of the most active and influential vice presidents in u s history this was evident as gore had weekly lunches with clinton to keep each other abreast of current developments although he later said that it was he who insisted on having those weekly lunches in the first place debate with perot in one nine nine three gore debated ross perot on cnn s larry king live on the issue of free trade public opinion polls taken after the debate showed that a majority of americans agreed with his point of view and supported nafta some claim that this performance may have been responsible for the passing of nafta in the house of representatives where it passed two three four two zero zero initatives one of gore s major accomplishments as vice president was the national performance review which pointed out waste fraud and other abuse in the federal government and stressed the need for cutting the size of the bureaucracy and the number of regulations his book later helped guide president clinton when he down sized the federal government internet education as vice president gore instituted a federal program calling for all schools and libraries to be wired to the internet this was a culmination of work that he had started several years before while serving in the senate gore had introduced legislation which called for the creation of a new federal research center for educational computing to support an information systems highway environment during gore s tenure as vice president he was a strong proponent for environmental protection while a senator working on his book earth in the balance gore had traveled around the world on numerous fact finding missions on earth day one nine nine four gore launched the worldwide globe program an innovative hands on school based education and science activity that made extensive use of the internet to increase student awareness of their environment and contribute research data for scientists the opinions he developed on issues such as global warming the depletion of the ozone layer and the destruction of rain forests is said to have played a major role in policy making for the clinton administration in the late nineties gore strongly pushed for the passage of the kyoto treaty which called for reduction in green house emissions foreign policy because of president clinton s inexperience and gore s service in vietnam and in the senate clinton would often look to gore for advice in the area of foreign policy gore was one of the first to call for action to remove yugoslav president slobodan milo evi from power in one nine nine eight gore also supported operation desert fox a three day bombing campaign against iraq that attempted to degrade saddam hussein s ability to make and to use weapons of mass destruction vice president al gore works along side president clinton in trying to negotiate a middle east peace plan with palestinian leader yasser arafat other during the clinton gore administration americans enjoyed eight years of relative peace along with the longest economic expansion in history democrats attributed this prosperity to the policies of the clinton gore administration and especially to the passage of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of one nine nine three for which gore cast the tie breaking vote during his two zero zero zero campaign for the presidency gore attributed several positive economic results to his and clinton s policies more than two two million new jobs highest homeownership in american history lowest unemployment in three zero years paid off three six zero billion of the national debt lowest poverty rate in two zero years higher incomes at all levels converted the largest budget deficit up to that time in american history to the largest surplus lowest government spending in three decades lowest federal income tax burden in three five years and more families own stock than ever before however gore later placed a large share of the blame for his election loss on the economic downturn and nasdaq crash of march two zero zero zero in an interview with national public radio s bob edwards two zero zero zero presidential election al gore and running mate joe lieberman at the two zero zero zero democratic national convention after two terms as vice president gore ran for president in the democratic primaries gore faced an early challenge from bill bradley gore s nomination was never really in doubt and bradley withdrew from the race in early march two zero zero zero after failing to win any state primary or caucus in august two zero zero zero gore surprised many when he selected united states senator joe lieberman to be his vice presidential running mate lieberman who is a more conservative democrat than gore had publicly blasted president clinton for the monica lewinsky affair many pundits saw gore s choice of lieberman as another way of trying to distance himself from the scandal prone clinton white house lieberman was also the first jewish nominee on a major party s national ticket during the entire campaign gore was neck and neck in the polls with republican governor of texas george w bush on election day the results were so close that the outcome of the race took over a month to resolve highlighted by the premature declaration of a winner on election night and an extremely close result in the state of florida on election night news networks first called florida for gore then fox news decided to call it for bush and all of the other news stations followed their decision the race was ultimately decided by a razor thin margin of only five three seven popular votes in florida a state favored to have gone to bush as his brother served as governor the five three seven number was an astonishingly close margin out of some one zero five million votes cast nationwide florida s two five electoral votes were awarded to george w bush only after numerous court challenges al gore publicly conceded the election after the supreme court in bush v gore voted seven to two to declare the ongoing recount procedure unconstitutional because it feared that different standards would be used in different parts of the state and five to four to ban recounts using other procedures al gore makes a point during a presidential debate during the two zero zero zero election as george w bush looks on gore strongly disagreed with the court s decision but decided for the sake of our unity of the people and the strength of our democracy i offer my concession he had previously made a concession phone call to bush the night of the election but quickly retracted it after learning just how close the election was following the election a subsequent recount conducted by various u s news media organizations indicated that mr bush would have won using the partial recount method of four strongly democratic areas advocated by mr gore but that mr gore would have won given a full recount of the state the states that ultimately voted for gore over bush in the two zero zero zero elections were new york new jersey rhode island connecticut delaware maine vermont massachusetts washington d c pennsylvania michigan wisconsin new mexico california oregon washington illinois iowa maryland minnesota and hawaii giving gore two six seven electoral votes to bush s two seven one one of gore s electors cast a blank ballot to protest what she called dc s colonial status thus the candidate s final number of electoral votes was two six six the florida election has been closely scrutinized since the election critics have argued that the governor of florida jeb bush brother of george w bush and the secretary of state of florida katherine harris did play a part in ensuring that the state was in the red column of the republicans come election day several irregularities are thought to have favored bush others may have given gore an edge irregularities favoring bush included the notorious palm beach butterfly ballots which were alleged to have produced an unexpectedly large number of votes for reform party candidate pat buchanan and a purge of some five zero zero zero zero alleged felons from the florida voting rolls that included some voters who were again eligible to vote under florida law many bush supporters however believed that an unfair advantage was given to gore when all major news networks early on prematurely projected gore as the winner of florida s two five electoral votes at seven five two pm eastern time this happened before the polls closed in one zero florida counties in the heavily republican western panhandle which are in the central time zone and thus closed at seven pm central time eight pm eastern some have thought that this depressed the pro bush vote in that area during the numerous recounts which made the phrase hanging chads infamous in the american vocabulary there were also allegations of both pro bush and pro gore tampering by low level operatives in the controversial counties it is unclear what effect if any this may have had and while the gore camp fought with some success to keep overseas absentee votes out in counties thought to be pro bush bush operatives similarly albeit while drawing less attention to their efforts prevented the counting of overseas absentee votes in strong democratic counties both sides contended that the votes were cast after election day and since many of the envelopes did not have cancelled stamps it was not clear when the votes were cast reports later surfaced that many overseas voters attempted to vote only after learning of the closeness of the florida vote some commentators still see such irregularities and the legal maneuvering around the recounts as casting doubt on the legitimacy of the vote as a matter of law however the issue was settled albeit controversially again when the u s congress accepted florida s electoral delegation only after a challenge to the florida electors was presented in the congressional chambers on january six two zero zero one by members of the congressional black caucus member after member went up decrying the lack of a senator who would be willing to co sponsor the challenge without any effect they thus failed to bring the challenge to a debate concern about the possible disenfranchisement of voters in the florida vote led to widespread calls for electoral reform in the united states and ultimately to the passage of the help america vote act which authorized the united states federal government to provide funds to the states to replace their mechanical voting equipment with electronic voting equipment however this has led to new controversies because of the security weaknesses of the computer systems the lack of paper based methods of secure verification and the necessity to rely on the trustworthiness of the manufacturers whose employees also count those votes although gore won the nationwide popular vote by more than five zero zero zero zero zero votes he lost the election by five electoral votes with one d c elector pledged to gore casting a blank ballot to protest the district s lack of representation in congress al gore on futurama joe lieberman later criticized al gore for adopting a populist theme during their two zero zero zero campaign lieberman said he objected to gore s people vs the powerful message believing it was not the best strategy for democrats to use to recapture the white house while running for president in two zero zero zero al gore was used as a voice actor for the television show futurama for which his daughter kristin was a writer he played himself again in another episode after the campaign was over private citizen professor gore al gore re emerges in two zero zero one as a visiting professor with a beard following his election loss gore accepted visiting professorships at columbia university s graduate school of journalism middle tennessee state university university of california los angeles and fisk university in late two zero zero one al gore became a senior advisor to google and vice chairman of los angeles based financial firm metropolitan west financial llc blasting bush on september two three two zero zero two gore spoke in san francisco to the commonwealth club and made a controversial speech blasting bush on the iraq war although he admitted saddam was a potential danger saying we know that saddam has stored secret supplies of biological and chemical weapons throughout his country iraq s search for weapons of mass destruction has proven impossible to deter and we should assume that it will continue for as long as saddam is in power he also spoke against rushing to war with iraq advising caution and saying that iraq was a diversion from fighting al qaeda and terrorism in afghanistan and elsewhere i don t think that we should allow anything to diminish our focus on avenging the three zero zero zero americans who were murdered and dismantling the network of terrorists who we know to be responsible for it the fact that we don t know where they are should not cause us to focus instead on some other enemy whose location may be easier to identify following the november five two zero zero two midterm elections gore re emerged into the public eye with a one four city book tour and a well orchestrated full gore media blitz which included a pair of policy speeches on september two three gore delivered a speech on the impending war with iraq and the war on terrorism that generated a fair amount of commentary less than two weeks later on october two he made a speech on bush s handling of the economy to the brookings institution also during this time period gore guest starred on several programs such as the late show with david letterman and saturday night live with legendary rock band phish appearing much more relaxed and funnier as a private citizen than he did while holding public office al gore hosting saturday night live along side west wing stars martin sheen and john spencer in two zero zero three gore joined the board of directors of apple computer on the political front gore kept his promise of staying involved in public debate when he offered his criticism and advice to the bush administration on key topics such as the occupation of iraq usa patriot act and environmental issues most notably global warming gore also continued to visit campuses across the nation lecturing on issues such as race media and democracy on april one zero two zero zero four gore met with the nine one one commission in private to give his testimony on what his administration did to prevent terror attacks in a statement after the three hour session the commission said he was candid and forthcoming and it thanked him for his continued cooperation in the summer of two zero zero four gore teamed up with moveon org to promote the new science fiction film the day after tomorrow although gore said the movie was a far fetched example of global warming he said the movie would escalate public debate on the issue on april two seven two zero zero five gore gave an hour long speech lambasting the gop s effort to do away with the legislative filibuster in response to senate majority leader bill frist who for weeks had repeated threats to impose the nuclear option if senate democrats did not stop blocking judicial nominees via the filibuster gore said their grand design is an all powerful executive using a weakened legislature to fashion a compliant judiciary in its own image the senate has confirmed two zero five or over nine five of president bush s nominees democrats have held up only one zero nominees less than five compare that with the six zero clinton nominees who were blocked by republican obstruction between one nine nine five and two zero zero zero what is involved here is a power grab gore said gore also took aim at what he called religious zealots who claim special knowledge of god s will in american politics he went on to say they even claim that those of us who disagree with their point of view are waging war against people of faith how dare they this was gore s first major policy speech of two zero zero five and also the first one since the defeat of democratic hopeful john kerry in late two zero zero four in may two zero zero five gore was awarded a lifetime achievement award for three decades of contributions to the internet the webby awards which are widely hailed as the oscars of the web wanted to set the record straight about al gore and the internet once and for all tiffany shlain the awards founder and chairwoman said it s just one of those instances someone did amazing work for three decades as congressman senator and vice president and it got spun around into this political mess shlain said in september two zero zero five gore chartered two aircraft to evacuate two seven zero evacuees from new orleans in the aftermath of hurricane katrina he was highly critical of the government and federal response in the days after the hurricane future speaking at an economic forum in stockholm sweden in october two zero zero five gore again stated that he has no intention of ever running for president again in response to questions from reporters however gore said he could not rule the possibility out completely saying i do not completely rule out some future interest but i do not expect to have that when asked how the united states would have been different if he had become president gore stated we would not have invaded a country that didn t attack us he said referring to iraq we would not have taken money from the working families and given it to the most wealthy families we would not be trying to control and intimidate the news media we would not be routinely torturing people gore said in the past few years gore has remained busy traveling the world speaking and participating in events mainly aimed towards global warming awareness and prevention on january two zero zero six al gore delivered a major speech criticising president bush s use of domestic wiretaps gore stated that bush broke the law and recommended an independent counsel investigate the matter further also in january two zero zero six al gore was the leading man in the sundance global warming documentary an inconvenient truth al gore will be publishing a second book on global warming titled an inconvenient truth in april two zero zero six on february one two two zero zero six former us vice president al gore on sunday said that the us government had committed terrible abuses against arabs living in america after nine one one attacks and that most americans did not support such treatment the thoughtless way in which visas are now handled that is a mistake mr gore said at the jeddah economic forum the worst thing we can possibly do is to cut off the channels of friendship and mutual understanding between saudi arabia and the united states the former us vice president told this saudi audience many of them educated in us universities that arabs in the united states had been indiscriminately rounded up often on minor charges of overstaying a visa or not having a green card in proper order and held in conditions that were just unforgivable unfortunately there have been terrible abuses and it s wrong i do want you to know that it does not represent the desires or wishes or feelings of the majority of the citizens of my country terrence jeffrey of human events and jack kelly of realclearpolitics com however criticized gore s comments and pointed out that nine one one commission page four nine two reported that khalid sheikh mohammed who planned the attacks told interrogators most of the hijackers he selected were saudis because they had the easiest time getting visas mohammad atta himself was in the united states having overstayed his visa television network al gore s current official logo on may four two zero zero four indtv holdings a company co founded by gore and joel hyatt purchased cable news channel newsworld international from vivendi universal the new network will not have political leanings gore said but will serve as an independent voice for a target audience of people between one eight and three four who want to learn about the world in a voice they recognize and a view they recognize as their own the network was relaunched under the name current on august one two zero zero five investment firm in late two zero zero four it was announced that al gore had launched and will chair an investment firm to seek out companies taking a responsible view on big global issues like climate change gore s group generation investment management was created to assist the growing demand for an investment style which can bring returns by blending traditional equity research with a focus on more intangible non financial factors such as social and environmental responsibility and corporate governance two zero zero four presidential election endorsing dean al gore shocked many when he did not endorse his two zero zero zero running mate joe lieberman but the outsider candidate howard dean in two zero zero three initially al gore was touted as a logical opponent of george w bush in the two zero zero four united states presidential election on december one six two zero zero two however gore announced that he would not run in two zero zero four saying that it was time for fresh faces and new ideas to emerge from the democrats when he appeared on a six zero minutes interview gore said that he felt if he had run the focus of the election would be the rematch rather than the issues gore s former running mate joe lieberman quickly announced his own candidacy for the presidency which he had vowed he would not do if gore ran despite gore taking himself out of the race a handful of his supporters formed a national campaign to draft him into running however that effort largely came to an end when gore publicly endorsed vermont governor howard dean over his former running mate joe lieberman weeks before the first primary of the election cycle there was still some effort to encourage write in votes for gore in the primaries by a different group of gore supporters who were separate from the draft movement although gore did receive a small number of votes in new hampshire and new mexico that effort was halted when john kerry pulled into the lead for the nomination gore s endorsement of dean was helpful to the latter in legitimizing him in the eyes of the establishment faction of the democratic party but it also led the media to dub dean as the clear front runner with the result that his opponents devoted more of their emphasis to opposing him campaigning against bush on january one five two zero zero four al gore gave a major policy address in new york city on climate change and the bush administration s approach to the environment accompanied by slides and projector gore slammed the bush administration s attitude towards global warming saying there are many who still do not believe that global warming is a problem at all and it s no wonder because they are the targets of a massive and well organized campaign of disinformation lavishly funded by polluters who are determined to prevent any action to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming out of a fear that their profits might be affected if they had to stop dumping so much pollution into the atmosphere on february nine two zero zero four on the eve of the tennessee primary gore gave what many consider his harshest criticism of the president yet when he accused george w bush of betraying the country by using the nine one one attacks as a justification for the invasion of iraq he betrayed this country mr gore shouted into the microphone he played on our fears he took america on an ill conceived foreign adventure dangerous to our troops an adventure preordained and planned before nine one one ever took place gore also urged all democrats to unite behind their eventual nominee proclaiming any one of these candidates is far better than george w bush in march two zero zero four gore along with former presidents bill clinton and jimmy carter united behind kerry as the presumptive democratic nominee al gore who just four years prior accepted his party s nomination speaks as a party elder at the two zero zero four democratic national convention on april two eight two zero zero four gore announced that he would be donating six million to various democratic party groups drawing from his funds left over from his two zero zero zero presidential campaign gore pledged to donate four million to the democratic national committee the party s senate and house committees would each get one million and the party from gore s home state of tennessee would receive two five zero zero zero zero in addition gore announced that all of the surplus funds in his recount fund from the two zero zero zero election controversy that resulted in the supreme court halting the counting of the ballots a total of two four zero zero zero zero will be donated to the florida democratic party in his speech gore stressed the importance of voting and having every vote counted a point that foreshadowed the two zero zero four u s election voting controversies on may two six two zero zero four gore gave a highly critical speech on the iraq crisis and the bush administration in the speech gore demanded secretary of defense donald rumsfeld national security advisor condoleezza rice director of central intelligence george tenet deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz undersecretary of defense for policy douglas feith and under secretary of defense for intelligence stephen cambone all resign for encouraging policies that led to the abuse of iraqi prisoners and fanned hatred of americans abroad during the fiery speech which lasted more than an hour gore called the bush administration s iraq war plan incompetent and called george w bush the most dishonest president since richard nixon who resigned the office of the presidency in one nine seven four following the watergate scandal gore also decried the abuse of prisoners in abu ghraib prison in iraq saying what happened at that prison it is now clear is not the result of random acts of a few bad apples it was the natural consequence of the bush administration policy convention as the first major speaker at the two zero zero four democratic national convention gore held himself out as a living reminder that every vote counts let s make sure not only that the supreme court does not pick the next president but also that this president is not the one who picks the next supreme court said gore gore directed remarks to supporters of third party presidential candidate ralph nader who abandoned the democratic party four years ago asking them do you still believe that there was no difference between the candidates post convention on october one eight two zero zero four al gore delivered his final major policy speech of the two zero zero four political season in an hour long presentation gore concluded that i m convinced that most of the president s frequent departures from fact based analysis have much more to do with right wing political and economic ideology than with the bible views and controversies gore is a strong supporter of abortion rights free trade and strong environmental policy he was a vocal opponent of the two zero zero three invasion of iraq gore has gradually moved politically further left he was once a moderate to conservative lawmaker while in congress gore had a strong pro life record on abortion and voted pro life two seven times when exactly gore became pro choice is unknown but by one nine eight eight when he sought the democratic presidential nomination he was on record as opposing the criminalization of abortion critics have charged gore with illegal fundraising at a buddhist temple and illegal use of his government office and telephone for political fundraising in violation of the hatch act although he was never indicted on such a charge the internet gore is a frequent target of satire based on his supposedly having claimed to have invented the internet in fact he never made such a claim rather during an interview with wolf blitzer on cnn s late edition on march nine one nine nine nine gore stated during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet i took the initiative in moving forward a whole range of initiatives that have proven to be important to our country s economic growth and environmental protection improvements in our educational system the phrase from the statement above which sparked the debate i took the initiative in creating the internet referred to gore s involvement with and sponsorship of the high performance computing act of one nine nine one which advanced the growth and mainstreaming of the internet during the one nine nine zero s this statement was later defended by internet pioneers robert kahn and vinton cerf as the two people who designed the basic architecture and the core protocols that make the internet work we would like to acknowledge vp gore s contributions as a congressman senator and as vice president no other elected official to our knowledge has made a greater contribution over a longer period of time accusations of hypocrisy by mcclellan and gonzales on the one six th of january two zero zero six gore accused u s president bush of breaking the law repeatedly and insistently and called for a special investigation of nsa spying on americans because the spying was without a warrant from a special federal court that authorizes such requests to eavesdrop on americans bush press secretary scott mcclellan and attorney general alberto gonzales both responded to reporters that the clinton gore administration had done illegal warrantless physical searches themselves of aldrich ames without permission from a judge i think his hypocrisy knows no bounds mcclellan said of gore but the foreign intelligence surveillance act at the time did not cover physical searches the law had changed in one nine nine five gore claimed that because gonzales made a political defense for bush he was no longer eligible to review charges against bush and therefore must name a special counsel his charges are factually wrong said gore both before and after the foreign intelligence surveillance act was amended in one nine nine five the clinton gore administration

veterans animal farm book cover animal farm is a satirical novel which can also be understood as a modern fable or allegory by george orwell ostensibly about a group of animals who oust the humans from the farm they live on and run it themselves only to have it corrupted into a brutal tyranny on its own it was written during world war ii and published in one nine four five although it was not widely successful until the late one nine five zero s animal farm is a thinly veiled critique and satire of soviet totalitarianism many events in the book are based on events from the soviet union during the stalin era orwell though a leftist he was for many years a member of the independent labour party was a critic of stalin and suspicious of moscow directed communism after his experiences in the spanish civil war plot when the farm s prize winning pig old major calls a meeting of all the animals of manor farm he tells them that he has had a dream in which mankind is gone and animals are free to live in peace and harmony he compares the humans to parasites and then proceeds to teach the animals a revolutionary song beasts of england the other animals begin to hope and dream for the revolution of such a day when old major dies a mere three days later three pigs snowball who teaches the animals to read napoleon and squealer assume command and turn his dream into a full fledged philosophy one night the starved animals suddenly revolt and drive the farmer mr jones his wife and his pet raven off the farm and take control the farm is renamed animal farm as the animals work towards a future utopia the seven commandments of the new philosophy of animalism are written on the wall of a barn for all to read the seventh and most important of which is that all animals are equal all animals work but the workhorse boxer does more than his fair share and adopts a maxim of his own i will work harder animal farm is off to a great start snowball teaches the other animals to read and write though few animals besides the pigs learn to read well food is plentiful due to a good harvest and the entire farm is organized and running smoothly even when mr jones tries his last ditch effort to retake control of the farm the animals easily defeat him at what they later call the battle of the cowshed soon however things begin to unravel as napoleon and snowball begin an epic power struggle over the farm when snowball announces his idea for a windmill napoleon quickly opposes it a meeting is held and when snowball makes his passionate and articulate speech in favour of the windmill napoleon only makes a brief retort and then makes a strange noise to call in nine attack dogs they burst in and chase snowball off of the farm in his absence napoleon declares himself the leader of the farm and makes instant changes he announces that meetings will no longer be held as before and a committee of pigs alone will decide what happens with the farm napoleon changes his mind about the windmill claiming through squealer that snowball stole the idea from him and the animals begin to work after a violent storm the animals wake to find the fruit of their months of labour utterly annihilated though neighbouring farmers scoff at the thin walls napoleon and squealer convince everyone that snowball destroyed it napoleon begins to purge the farm killing many animals he accuses of consorting with snowball in the meantime boxer takes a second mantra napoleon is always right napoleon begins to abuse his powers even more and life on the farm becomes harder and harder for the rest of the animals the pigs impose more and more controls on them while reserving privileges for themselves history is rewritten to villainise snowball and glorify napoleon even further each step of this development is justified by the pig squealer who on several occasions alters the seven commandments on the barn in the dead of night the song beasts of england is banned as inappropriate now that the dream of animal farm has been realised and is replaced by an anthem glorifying napoleon who begins to live more and more like a human the animals though cold starving and overworked remain convinced that they are still better off than when they were ruled by a man named jones mr frederick one of the two neighbouring farmers swindles napoleon by paying with forged banknotes and then attacks the farm and uses dynamite to blow up the recently restored windmill though the animals of animal farm eventually win the battle they do so at a great cost as many of the animals including boxer are wounded however boxer continues to work harder and harder until he finally collapses while working on the windmill napoleon sends for a van to come and take boxer to the veterinarian but as boxer is loaded up and the van drives away the animals read what is written on the side of the van alfred simmonds horse slaughterer and glue boiler squealer quickly reports that the van with the old writing has been purchased by the hospital and later that boxer has died in the hospital in spite of the best medical care many years pass and the pigs learn to walk upright carry whips and wear clothes the seven commandments are reduced to a single phrase all animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others napoleon holds a dinner party for the pigs and the humans of the area in the adjacent foxwood farm run by mr pilkington he announces his alliance with the humans against the labouring classes of both worlds the animals discover this when they overhear napoleon s conversations and finally realize that a change has come over the ruling pigs during a poker match an argument breaks out between napoleon and mr pilkington when they both play an ace of spades and the animals realise how they cannot tell the difference between the pigs and the humans the pigs walked on two feet and they adopted many of mr jones customs and principles the pigs have violated every one of the rules set out in the beginning which they set up this is when we come to the theme of this book power corrupts plot references to real events the ousting of the humans after the farmers forget to feed the animals russian revolution of one nine one seven led to the removal of the tsars after a series of famine and poverty the refusal of the humans to refer to animal farm by its new name still calling it manor farm may be indicative of the diplomatic limbo in which the soviets existed following their early history mr jones last ditch effort to re take the farm the battle of the cowshed russian civil war in which the western capitalist governments sent soldiers to try to remove the bolsheviks from power napoleon s removal of snowball stalin s removal of leon trotsky from power in one nine two seven and his subsequent expulsion napoleon stealing snowball s idea for a windmill stalin later shifted away from world socialism to socialism in one country which trotsky had originally promoted the windmill can also be considered a symbol of the soviet five year plans a concept developed by trotsky and adopted by stalin who claimed them to be his idea moses the raven leaving the farm for a while and then returning similar to the russian orthodox church going underground and then being brought back to give the workers hope boxer s motto napoleon is always right is strikingly similar to mussolini is always right a chant used to hail benito mussolini during his rule of italy from one nine two two to one nine four three during the rise of napoleon he ordered the collection of all the hens eggs in an act of defiance the hens destroyed their eggs rather than give them to napoleon during stalin s collectivization period in the early one nine three zero s many ukrainian peasants burned their crops and farms rather than handing them over to the government napoleon s mass executions of which many were unfair for the alleged crimes stalin executed his political enemies for various crimes after they were tortured and forced to falsely confess the four pigs that go against napoleon s will represent the white movement napoleon s replacement of the farm anthem beasts of england with an inane composition by the pig poet minimus animal farm animal farm never through me will you come to harm in one nine four three stalin replaced the old national anthem the internationale with the hymn of the soviet union the old internationale glorified the revolution and the people the original version of the hymn of the soviet union glorified stalin so heavily that after his death in one nine five three entire sections of the anthem had to be replaced or removed orwell could have also been referring to napoleon bonaparte s banning of the french national hymn la marseillaise in one seven nine nine napoleon s dealing with mr frederick who eventually betrays animal farm and destroys the windmill though animal farm repels the human attack many animals are wounded and killed stalin s molotov ribbentrop pact with nazi germany in one nine three nine which was later betrayed in one nine four one when hitler invaded the soviet union though the soviet union won the war it came at a tremendous price of roughly eight five one five million soviet soldiers unconfirmed and many civilians coming to an incredible estimated two zero million dead as well as the utter destruction of the western soviet union and its prized collective farms which stalin had created in the one nine three zero s napoleon s later alliance with the humans stalin s non aggression pact with hitler in the early years of wwii napoleon s changing animal farm back to manor the red army s name was changed from the workers and peasants red army to the soviet army to appear as a more appealing and professional organization rather than an army of the common people after old major dies his skull is placed on display on a tree stump similarly lenin s whom old major is based on along with karl marx embalmed body was put on display in lenin s tomb in red square postmortem where it still remains squealer constantly changing the commandments is said to be a reference to a perversion in russian religious history as observed by leo tolstoy when the essential precepts of the sermon on the mount were altered by russian orthodox church it may also refer to the revision of history texts to glorify stalin during his regime characters the events and characters in animal farm are all carefully drawn to represent the history of the soviet union orwell makes this explicit in the case of napoleon whom he directly connects to stalin in a letter of one seven march one nine four five to the publisher when the windmill is blown up i wrote all the animals including napoleon flung themselves on their faces i would like to alter it to all the animals except napoleon if that has been printed it s not worth bothering about but i just thought the alteration would be fair to js joseph stalin as he did stay in moscow during the german advance the other characters have their analogies in the real world but care should be taken with these comparisons as they do not always match history exactly and often simply represent generalised concepts the pigs napoleon the pig who becomes the leader of animal farm post rebellion created based on the actions of joseph stalin he uses his military of nine attack dogs to cement his power through fear napoleon craftily drives out his opponent snowball snowball the pig who fights napoleon for control post rebellion inspired by leon trotsky snowball is a passionate intellectual and is far more honest about his motives than napoleon snowball easily wins the loyalty of most of the animals trotsky was driven into exile in mexico where he was assassinated squealer the pig who serves as public speaker inspired by vyacheslav molotov and the russian paper pravda squealer twists and abuses the language to excuse justify and extol napoleon s actions no matter how egregious all his life george orwell made it a point to show how politicians used language squealer limits the debate by complicating it and he confuses and disorients making claims that the pigs need the extra luxury they are taking in order to function properly to squeal is to betray something squealer does often to his fellow animals minimus a poet pig who writes a song about napoleon representing admirers of stalin both inside and outside the ussr such as maxim gorky old major as a fellow socialist orwell agreed with some of karl marx s politics and even respected vladimir lenin in fact the satire in animal farm is not of marxism or lenin s revolution but of the corruption that occurred later major who is based upon both lenin and marx is the inspiration which fuels the rest of the book though it is a positive image orwell does slip some flaws in old major such as how during his complaints about the abuse of animals he admits that he has been largely free from those terrors pinkeye a small piglet who tastes napoleon s food for poisoning piglets while not truly noted in the novel these piglets are hinted to be the children of napoleon and are the first generation of animals to actually be subjugated to his idea of animal inequality the humans mr jones the original owner of manor farm he is probably based on tsar nicholas ii mr frederick the tough owner of pinchfield a well kept neighbouring farm he is probably based on germany and or adolf hitler mr pilkington the easy going but crafty owner of foxwood a neighbouring farm he represents britain and or winston churchill mr whymper a human whom napoleon hires to represent animal farm in human society he is loosely based on george bernard shaw who visited the ussr in one nine three one and praised what he found the other animals boxer possibly one of the more popular characters boxer is the tragic avatar of the working class or proletariat loyal dedicated and strong his major flaw however is his blind trust of the leaders and his inability to see corruption he is used and abused by the pigs as much or more than he was by jones his death serves to show just how far the pigs are willing to go a strong and loyal draft horse boxer played a huge part in keeping the farm together prior to his death boxer could also represent a stakhanovite his name is a reference to the boxer rebellion clover boxer s close friend and also a draft horse she blames herself for forgetting the original seven commandments when squealer revises them she represents the middle class educated people who acquiesce to the subversion of principles by the powerful mollie a horse who likes wearing ribbons which represent luxury and being pampered by humans she represents upper class people the bourgeoisie who fled from the u s s r after the russian revolution benjamin a donkey who is cynical about the revolution he is said to be inspired by orwell himself he represented the skeptical people in and out of russia who believed that communism would not help the people of russia moses a tame raven who spreads stories of sugarcandy mountain the animal heaven these beliefs are denounced by the pigs moses represents religion specifically the russian orthodox church which has always been in conflict with communism it is interesting to note that while moses initially leaves the farm after the rebellion he later returns and is supported by the pigs this represents the cynical use of religion by the state to anaesthetise the minds of the masses muriel a goat who reads the edited commandments she may represent intelligent labour jessie and bluebell two dogs who give birth in chapter iii their puppies are nurtured by napoleon to inspire fear without doubt representing the formation of the nkvd kgb the hens represent the kulaks landed peasants persecuted by stalin the dogs napoleon s secret police and bodyguards inspired by cheka nkvd ogpu mvd the sheep the sheep show the dumb animal following of the proletariats in the midst of the russian civil war four legs good two legs bad significance the book is an allegory about the events following the revolution in the soviet union and in particular the rise of stalinism and the betrayal of the revolution which basically replaced one dictatorship for another orwell wrote the book following his experiences during the spanish civil war which are described in another of his books homage to catalonia he intended it to be a strong condemnation of what he saw as the stalinist corruption of the original socialist ideals in which he believed and continued to believe after he saw a revolution betrayed as in spain for the preface of a ukrainian edition he prepared in one nine four seven orwell describes what gave him the idea of setting the book on a farm i saw a little boy perhaps ten years old driving a huge cart horse along a narrow path whipping it whenever it tried to turn it struck me that if only such animals became aware of their strength we should have no power over them and that men exploit animals in much the same way as the rich exploit the proletariat this ukrainian edition was an early propaganda use of the book it was printed to be distributed among the soviet citizens of ukraine who were just some of the many millions of displaced persons throughout europe at the end of the second world war the american occupation forces did not appreciate these illegal presses printing propaganda and confiscated one five zero zero copies of animal farm handing them to the soviet authorities the politics in the book also affected britain with orwell reporting that ernest bevin was terrified that it may cause embarrassment if published before the one nine four five general election in recent years the book has been used to compare new movements that overthrow heads of a corrupt and undemocratic government or organization only to become corrupt and oppressive themselves over time as they succumb to the trappings of power and begin using violent and dictatorial methods to keep it such analogies have been used for many former african colonies such as zimbabwe and democratic republic of congo whose succeeding african born rulers were thought to be as corrupt as the european colonists they supplanted in schools animal farm is used in the core knowledge curriculum core knowledge is based on the interaction of different subjects in schools the way animal farm comes into play is that if a student s geography or history class is learning about the former soviet union the english class will be reading animal farm post publication views of the book in the post war years it became apparent to orwell that anti russian literature was not something which most major publishing houses would touch including his regular publisher gollancz one publisher he sought to sell his book to rejected it on the grounds of government advice although it was later found that the civil servant who gave the order was a soviet spy orwell originally prepared a preface on freedom of the press for the book which noted the sinister fact about literary censorship in england is that it is largely voluntary things are kept right out of the british press not because the government intervened but because of a general tacit agreement that it wouldn t do to mention that particular fact somewhat ironically the preface itself was censored and is not published with most copies of the book film versions the book was the basis of an animated feature film in one nine five five britain s first full length animated movie directed by john halas and joy batchelor and quietly commissioned by the american cia which softened the theme of the story slightly by reducing the role of moses the character representing religion and adding an epilogue that occurs immediately after the novel s iconic concluding imagery is depicted where the other animals successfully revolt against the pigs there was also a one nine nine nine live action film directed by john stephenson with voices by kelsey grammer as snowball patrick stewart as napoleon and ian holm as squealer despite a few differences such as completely different songs and jesse being the first to question the pigs much of the plot is loyal to the book the film diverges from the book with an additional epilogue in which jesse and several animals escape and return years later to a post napoleon era animal farm cultural references pink floyd s one nine seven seven album animals was partially inspired by animal farm it categorises people as pigs dogs or sheep in an episode of johnny bravo aunt katie s farm johnny while dressed in a pig costume goes crazy and yells four legs good two legs bad over and over radical

eggs amphibians from greek both and life generally spend part of their time on land but they do not have the adaptations to an entirely terrestrial existence found in most other modern tetrapods amniotes there are about five nine five zero described living species of amphibians the study of amphibians and reptiles is known as herpetology history of amphibians fire salamander salamandra salamandra amphibians developed with the characteristics of pharyngeal slits gills a dorsal nerve cord a notochord and a post anal tail at different stages of their life they have persisted since the dawn of tetrapods three nine zero million years ago in the devonian period when they were the first four legged animals to develop lungs during the following carboniferous period they also developed the ability to walk on land to avoid aquatic competition and predation while allowing them to travel from water source to water source as a group they maintained the status of the dominant animal for nearly seven five million years throughout their history they have ranged in size from the three foot nine zero cm long devonian ichthyostega to the slightly larger five foot one five zero cm long permian eryops and down to the tiny brachycephalus didactylus brazilian gold frog and eleutherodactylus iberia from cuba with a total length of nine six nine eight millimeters zero four inches amphibians have mastered almost every climate on earth from the hottest deserts to the frozen arctic classification caecilian from the san antonio zoo traditionally the amphibians are taken to include all tetrapods that are not amniotes recent amphibians all belong to a single subgroup of these called the lissamphibia recently there has been a tendency to restrict the class amphibia to the lissamphibia i e to exclude tetrapods that are not more closely related to modern forms than they are to modern reptiles birds and mammals there are two ancient extinct subclasses subclass labyrinthodontia paraphyletic subclass lepospondyli of the remaining modern subclass lissamphibia there are three orders order anura frogs and toads in superorder salientia five two two eight species order caudata or urodela salamanders five five two species order gymnophiona or apoda caecilians one seven one species authorities disagree on whether salientia is a superorder that includes the order anura or whether anura is a sub order of the order salientia in effect salientia includes all the anura plus a single triassic proto frog species triadobatrachus massinoti practical considerations seem to favour using the former arrangement now reproduction for the purpose of reproduction most amphibians are bound to fresh water a few tolerate brackish water but there are no true sea water amphibians several hundred frog species in adaptive radiations e g eleutherodactylus the pacific platymantines the australo papuan microhylids and many other tropical frogs however do not need any water whatsoever they reproduce via direct development an ecological and evolutionary adaptation that has allowed them to be completely independent from free standing water almost all of these frogs live in wet tropical rainforests and their eggs hatch directly into miniature versions of the adult bypassing the tadpole stage entirely several species have also adapted to arid and semi arid environments but most of them still need water to lay their eggs symbiosis with single celled algae that lives in the jelly like layer of the eggs has evolved several times the larvae tadpoles or polliwogs breathe with exterior gills after hatching they start to transform gradually into the adult s appearance this process is called metamorphosis typically the animals then leave the water and become terrestrial adults but there are many interesting exceptions to this general way of reproduction the most obvious part of the amphibian metamorphosis is the formation of four legs in order to support the body on land but there are several other changes the gills are replaced by other respiratory organs i e lungs the skin changes and develops glands to avoid dehydration the eyes get eyelids and adapt to vision outside the water an eardrum is developed to lock the middle ear in frogs and toads the tail disappears amphibian conservation the golden toad of monteverde costa rica was among the first casualties of amphibian declines formerly abundant it was last seen in one nine eight nine dramatic declines in amphibian populations including population crashes and mass localized extinction have been noted in the past two decades from locations all over the world and amphibian declines are thus perceived as one of the most critical threats to global biodiversity a number of causes are believed to be involved including habitat destruction and modification over exploitation pollution introduced species climate change and disease however many of the causes of amphibian

as of two zero zero zero according to the two zero zero zero u s census alaska is most likely ranked the fourth smallest state population wise in the u s with wyoming vermont and by now north dakota smaller than alaska the name alaska is most likely derived from the aleut word alyeska meaning greater land as opposed to the aleut word aleutia meaning lesser land to the aleuts this distinction was a linguistic variation distinguishing the mainland from an island it is bordered by yukon territory and british columbia canada to the east the gulf of alaska and the pacific ocean to the south the bering sea bering strait and chukchi sea to the west and the beaufort sea and the arctic ocean to the north alaska is the largest state by area in the united states it is larger in area than all but one eight of the world s nations history alaska was first inhabited by humans who came across the bering land bridge eventually alaska became populated by the inupiaq inuit and yupik eskimos aleuts and a variety of american indian groups most if not all of the pre columbian population of the americas probably took this route and continued further south and east the first written accounts indicate that the first europeans to reach alaska came from russia vitus bering sailed east and saw mt st elias the russian american company hunted sea otters for their fur the colony was never very profitable because of the costs of transportation at the urging of u s secretary of state william seward the united states senate approved the purchase of alaska from russia for seven two zero zero zero zero zero approximately one three four zero zero zero zero zero zero in two zero zero five dollars adjusted for inflation on nine april one eight six seven and the united states flag was raised on one eight october of that same year now called alaska day coincident with the ownership change the de facto international date line was moved westward and alaska changed from the julian calendar to the gregorian calendar therefore for residents friday october six one eight six seven was followed by friday october one eight one eight six seven two fridays in a row because of the date line shift the first american administrator of alaska was polish immigrant w odzimierz krzy anowski the purchase was not popular in the contiguous united states where alaska became known as seward s folly or seward s icebox alaska celebrates the purchase each year on the last monday of march calling it seward s day after the purchase of alaska between one eight six seven and one eight eight four the name was changed to the department of alaska between one eight eight four and one nine one two it was called the district of alaska president dwight d eisenhower signed the alaska statehood act into united

north american history on good friday one nine six four see good friday earthquake in one nine seven six the people of alaska amended the state s constitution establishing the alaska permanent fund the fund invests a portion of the state s mineral revenue including revenue from the trans alaskan pipeline system to benefit all generations of alaskans in march two zero zero five the fund s value

time utc nine hours around yakutat alaska hawaii standard time utc one zero hours in the anchorage and fairbanks vicinity with the nome area and most of the aleutian islands observing bering standard time utc one one hours in one nine eight three the number of time zones was reduced to two with the entire mainland plus the inner aleutian islands going to utc nine hours and this zone then being renamed alaska standard time as the yukon territory had several years earlier circa one nine seven five adopted a single time zone identical to pacific standard time and the remaining aleutian islands were slotted into the utc one zero hours zone which was then renamed hawaii aleutian standard time over the years various vessels have been named uss alaska in honor of the state during world war ii three of the outer aleutian islands attu agattu and kiska were occupied by japanese troops it was the only territory within the current borders of the united states to have land occupied during the war politics alaska is often characterized as a republican leaning state with strong libertarian tendencies local political communities often work on issues related to land use development fishing tourism and individual rights as many residents are proud of their rough alaskan heritage alaska natives while organized in and around their communities are often active within the native corporations which have been given ownership over large tracts of land and thus need to deliberate resource conservation and development issues in presidential elections the state s electoral college votes have been most often won by a republican nominee only once has alaska supported a democratic nominee when it supported lyndon b johnson in the landslide year of one nine six four although the one nine six zero and one nine six eight elections were close no state has voted for a democratic presidential candidate fewer times president george w bush won the state s electoral votes in two zero zero four by a margin of two five percentage points with six one one of the vote juneau stands out as an area that supports democratic candidates when the united states congress in one nine five seven and one nine five eight debated the wisdom of admitting it as the four nine th state much of the political debate centered on whether alaska would become a democratic or republican leaning state conventional wisdom had it that with its rugged individualism penchant for new ideas and dependence on the federal government largess for basic needs it would become a democratic stronghold about which republicans and the then republican administration of dwight eisenhower had reservations given time those fears proved roundly unfounded after an early flirtatious period with liberal politics the political climate of alaska changed quickly once petroleum was discovered and the federal government came to be seen as meddling in local affairs still despite its libertarian leanings the state regularly takes in more federal money than it gives out a fact that can be attributed at least partially to its equal representation in the united states senate in recent years the alaska legislature is a two zero member senate serving four year terms and four zero member house serving two year terms it has been dominated by conservatives generally republicans likewise recent state governors have been mostly conservatives although not always elected under the official party banner republican wally hickel was elected to the office for a second term in one nine nine zero after jumping the republican ship and briefly joining the alaskan independence party ticket just long enough to be reelected he subsequently officially rejoined the republican fold in one nine nine four alaska s members of the u s congress are all republican u s senator ted stevens was appointed to the position following the death of u s senator bob bartlett in december of one nine six eight and has never lost a re election campaign since as the longest serving republican in the senate some political wits call him senator for life stevens has been a crucial force in gaining federal money for his state until his resignation from the u s senate to run for governor republican frank murkowski held the state s other senatorial position and as governor was allowed to appoint his daughter lisa murkowski as his successor she won a full six year term on her own in two zero zero four alaska s sole u s house representative don young won re election to his one seven th straight term also in two zero zero four his seniority in house ranks him as one of the most influential republican house members his position on the house transportation committee allowed him to parlay some four five zero million to two bridge projects in alaska named the bridges to nowhere for which he gained national notoriety following the devastation in the state of louisiana following hurricane katrina and his insistence that the money not be returned to aid in rebuilding the gulf coast geography near little port walter alaska is one of the two states that is not bordered by another us state hawaii being the other it is the only state that is both in north america and is not part of the four eight contiguous states about five zero zero miles eight zero zero kilometers of canadian territory separate alaska from washington therefore alaska is an exclave of the united states that is part of the continental u s but is not part of the contiguous u s it is also the only mainland state whose capital city is accessible only via ship or air there are no roads connecting juneau to the rest of the state alaska is the largest state in the united states in terms of land area five seven zero three seven four square miles one four seven seven two six one km if a map of alaska were superimposed upon a map of the continental united states alaska would overlap texas oklahoma kansas new mexico and colorado alaska has the longest coastline of any state one scheme for describing the state s geography is by labeling the regions south central alaska is the southern coastal region and is the population center for the state the municipality of anchorage and many small but growing towns such as palmer and wasilla lie within this area petroleum industrial plants transportation tourism and two military bases form the core of the economy here the alaska panhandle also known as southeast alaska is home to juneau many small towns tidewater glaciers and extensive forests tourism fishing forestry and state government anchor the economy the alaska interior is home to fairbanks the geography is marked by large braided rivers such as the yukon river and the kuskokwim river as well as arctic tundra lands and shorelines the alaskan bush is the remote less crowded part of the state encompassing three eight zero native villages and small towns such as nome bethel kotzebue and most famously barrow the northernmost town in the united states the northeast corner of alaska is covered by the arctic national wildlife refuge which covers one nine zero four nine two three six acres seven nine three one eight km with its numerous islands alaska has nearly three four zero zero zero miles five four seven zero zero km of tidal shoreline the island chain extending west from the southern tip of the alaska peninsula is called the aleutian islands many active volcanoes are found in the aleutians for example unimak island is home to mount shishaldin a moderately active volcano that rises to nine nine eight zero ft three zero four two m above sea level the chain of volcanoes extends to mount spurr west of anchorage on the mainland north america s second largest tides occur in turnagain arm just south of anchorage which often sees tidal differences of more than three five feet one zero seven m alaska is home to three five million lakes of two zero acres eight ha or larger marshlands and wetland permafrost cover one eight eight three two zero square miles four eight seven seven four seven km mostly in northern western and southwest flatlands frozen water in the form of glacier ice covers some one six zero zero zero square miles four one four four zero km of land and one two zero zero square miles three one zero eight km of tidal zone the bering glacier complex near the southeastern border with yukon canada covers two two five zero square miles five eight two seven km alone the aleutian islands actually cross longitude one eight zero also making it the easternmost state although the international date line doglegs around them to keep the whole state in the same day it is part of the extreme points of the united states according to the october one nine nine eight report of the united states bureau of land management approximately six five of alaska is owned and managed by the u s federal government as national forests national parks and national wildlife refuges of these the bureau of land management manages eight seven million acres three five zero zero zero zero km or two three eight of the state the arctic national wildlife refuge is managed by the united states fish and wildlife service of the remaining land area the state of alaska owns two four five another one zero is managed by thirteen regional and dozens of local native corporations created under the alaska native claims settlement act various private interests own the remaining land totaling less than one see also list of alaska rivers alaska peninsula bristol bay boroughs and census areas alaska has no counties in the sense used in the rest of the country instead the state is divided into two seven census areas and boroughs the difference between boroughs and census areas is that boroughs have an organized area wide government while census areas are artificial divisions defined by the united states census bureau for statistical purposes only areas of the state not in organized boroughs compose what the government of alaska calls the unorganized borough borough level government services in the unorganized borough are provided by the state itself economy greetings from alaska the state s two zero zero three total gross state product was three one billion its per capita income for two zero zero three was three three two one three one four th in the nation alaska s main export is seafood agriculture represents only a fraction of the alaska economy agricultural production is primarily for consumption within the state and includes nursery stock dairy products vegetables and livestock manufacturing is limited with most foodstuffs and general goods imported from elsewhere employment is primarily in government and industries such as natural resource extraction shipping and transportation military bases are a significant component of the economy in both fairbanks and anchorage its industrial outputs are crude petroleum natural gas coal gold precious metals zinc and other mining seafood processing timber and wood products there is also a growing service and tourism sector tourists have contributed to the economy by supporting local lodging the cost of goods in alaska has long been higher than in the contiguous four eight states this has changed for the most part in anchorage and fairbanks where the cost of living is actually less than some major cities in the lower four eight thanks to lower housing and transportation costs the introduction of big box stores in anchorage fairbanks and juneau also did much to lower prices however rural alaska suffers from extremely high prices for food and consumer goods compared to the rest of the country due to the relatively limited transportation infrastructure many rural residents come in to these cities and purchase food and goods in bulk from warehouse clubs like costco and sam s club some have embraced the free shipping offers of some online retailers to purchase items much more cheaply than they could in their own communities if they are available at all transportation bridge on alaska highway between watson lake and whitehorse alaska is arguably the least connected state in terms of road transportation the state s road system covers a relatively small area of the state linking the central population centers and the alaska highway the principal route out of the state through canada the state capital juneau is not accessible by road which has spurred several debates over the decades about moving the capital to a city on the road system one unique feature of the road system is the anton anderson memorial tunnel which links the seward highway south of anchorage with the relatively isolated community of whittier the tunnel held the title of the longest road tunnel in north america at nearly two five miles four km until completion of the three five mile five six km interstate nine three tunnel as part of the big dig project in boston massachusetts the anderson tunnel combines a one lane roadway and train tracks in the same housing consequently eastbound traffic westbound traffic and the alaska railroad must share the tunnel resulting in waits of two zero minutes or more to enter as reflected on the alaska department of transportation tunnel website it is now considered north america s longest railroad highway tunnel the alaska railroad runs from seward through anchorage denali and fairbanks to north pole with spurs to whittier and palmer the railroad is famous for its summertime passenger services but also plays a vital part in moving alaska s natural resources such as coal and gravel to ports in anchorage whittier and seward the alaska railroad is the only remaining railroad in north america to use cabooses on its freight trains a stretch of the track along an area inaccessible by road serves as the only transportation to cabins in the area most cities and villages in the state are accessible only by sea or air alaska has a well developed ferry system known as the alaska marine highway which serves the cities of southeast and the alaska peninsula the system also operates a ferry service from bellingham washington up the inside passage to skagway cities not served by road or sea can only be reached by air accounting for alaska s extremely well developed bush air services an alaskan novelty anchorage itself and to a lesser extent fairbanks are serviced by many major airlines air travel is the cheapest and most efficient form of transportation in and out of the state anchorage recently completed extensive remodeling and construction at ted stevens anchorage international airport to help accommodate the upsurge in tourism unofficial sources have estimated the numbers for two zero zero four at some four million tourists arriving in alaska between may and september however regular flights to most villages and towns within the state are commercially challenging to provide alaska airlines is the only major airline offering in state travel with jet service sometimes in combination cargo and passenger boeing seven three seven two zero zero s from anchorage and fairbanks to regional hubs like bethel nome kotzebue dillingham kodiak and other larger communities as well as to major southeast and alaska peninsula communities the bulk of remaining commercial flight offerings come from small regional commuter airlines like era aviation penair and frontier flying service the smallest towns and villages must rely on scheduled or chartered bush flying services using general aviation aircraft such as the cessna caravan the most popular aircraft in use in the state much of this service can be attributed to the alaska bypass mail program which subsidizes bulk mail delivery to alaskan rural communities the program requires seven zero of that subsidy to go to carriers who offer passenger service to the communities but perhaps the most quintessentially alaskan plane is the bush seaplane the world s busiest seaplane base is lake hood located next to ted stevens anchorage international airport where flights bound for remote villages without an airstrip carry passengers cargo and lots of items from stores and warehouse clubs another alaskan transportation method is the dogsled in modern times dog mushing is more of a sport than a true means of transportation various races are held around the state but the best known is the iditarod a one one five zero mile one eight five zero km trail from anchorage to nome the race commemorates the famous one nine two five serum run to nome in which mushers and dogs like balto took much needed medicine to the diphtheria stricken community of nome when all other means of transportation had failed mushers from all over the world come to anchorage each march to compete for cash prizes and prestige demographics as of two zero zero five alaska has an estimated population of six six three six six one which is an increase of five nine zero six or zero nine from the prior year and an increase of three six seven three zero or five nine since the year two zero zero zero this includes a natural increase since the last census of three six five nine zero people derived from its five three one three two births of which one six five four two deaths is subtracted from and an increase due to net migration of one one eight one people into the state immigration from outside the united states resulted in a net increase of five eight zero zero people and migration within the country produced a net loss of four six one nine people

suicides this is a controversial topic for many residents alaska has also had a problem with brain drain as many of its young people including most of the highest academic achievers leave the state upon graduating high school while for many this functions as a sort of walkabout many do not return to the state the university of alaska has been successfully combating this by offering four year

inventors and others devoted to improving farming methods and implements are also said to be engaged in agriculture more people in the world are involved in agriculture as their primary economic activity than in any other yet it only accounts for four percent of the world s gdp overview tea plantation in java indonesia agriculture sometimes refers to subsistence agriculture the production of

and increasingly so elsewhere which consists of obtaining financial income from the cultivation of land to yield produce the commercial raising of animals animal husbandry or both agriculture is also

agriculture depends heavily on engineering and technology and on the biological and physical sciences irrigation drainage conservation and sanitary engineering each of which is important in successful farming are some of the fields requiring the specialized knowledge of agricultural engineers agricultural chemistry deals with other vital farming concerns such as the application of fertilizer insecticides see pest control and fungicides soil makeup analysis of agricultural products and nutritional needs of farm animals plant breeding and genetics contribute additionally to farm productivity advanced seed engineering has allowed strains of seed to become perfect in every farming situation seeds can now germinate faster and adapt to shorter growing seasons in different climates present day seed can resist the spraying of pesticides that kill all green leaf plants hydroponics a method of soilless gardening in which plants are grown in chemical nutrient solutions may help meet the need for greater food production as the world s population increases the packing processing and marketing of agricultural products are closely related activities also influenced by

the two zero th century early in the century it took one american farmer to produce food for two five people where today due to engineering technology also plant breeding and agrichemicals a single farmer can feed over one three zero people this comes at a cost however of large amounts of energy input from unsustainable mostly fossil fuel sources animal husbandry means breeding and raising animals for meat or to harvest animal products like milk eggs or wool on a continual basis in recent years some aspects of industrial intensive agriculture have been the subject of increasing discussion the widening sphere of influence held by large seed and chemical companies meat packers and food processors has been a source of concern both within the farming community and for the general public there has been increased activity of some people against some farming practices raising chickens for food being one example another issue is the type of feed given to some animals that can cause bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle there has also been concern because of the disastrous effect that intensive agriculture has on the environment in the us for example fertilizer has been running off into the mississippi for years and has caused a dead spot in the gulf of mexico where the mississippi empties intensive agriculture also depletes the fertility of the land over time and the end effect is that which happened in the middle east were some of the most fertile farmland in the world was turned into a desert by intensive agriculture the patent protection given to companies that develop new types of seed using genetic engineering has allowed seed to be licensed to farmers in much the same way that computer software is licensed to users this has changed the balance of power in favor of the seed companies allowing them to dictate terms and conditions previously unheard of some argue these companies are guilty of biopiracy soil conservation and nutrient management have been important concerns since the one nine five zero s with the best farmers taking a stewardship role with the land they operate however increasing contamination of waterways and wetlands by nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus are of concern in many countries increasing consumer awareness of agricultural issues has led to the rise of community supported agriculture local food movement slow food and commercial organic farming though these yet remain fledgling industries history ancient egyptian farmer main article history of agriculture archaeobotanists paleoethnobotanists have traced the selection and cultivation of specific food plant characteristics such as a semi tough rachis and larger seeds to just after the younger dryas about nine five zero

zero th millennium bc using the world s earliest known type of sickle blades there is even earlier evidence for conscious cultivation and seasonal harvest grains of rye with domestic traits have been recovered from epi palaeolithic one zero zero zero zero bc contexts at abu hureyra in syria but this appears to be a localised phenomenon resulting from cultivation of stands of wild rye rather than a definitive step towards domestication it is not until ca eight five zero zero bc in middle eastern cultures referred to as pre pottery neolithic b ppnb where there is the first definite evidence for the emergence of a widespread subsistence economy that was dependent on domesticated plants and animals in these contexts lie the origins of the eight so called founder crops of agriculture firstly emmer wheat einkorn wheat then hulled barley pea lentil bitter vetch chick pea and flax these eight crops occur more or less simultaneously on ppnb sites in this region although the consensus is that wheat was the first to be sown and harvested on a significant scale there are many sites that date to between ca eight five zero zero bc and seven five zero zero bc where the systematic farming of these crops contributed the major part of the inhabitants diet from the fertile crescent agriculture spread eastwards to central asia and westwards into cyprus anatolia and by seven zero zero zero bc

introduction of farming may have included climate change but possibly there were also social reasons e g accumulation of food surplus for competitive gift giving most certainly there was a gradual transition from hunter gatherer to agricultural economies after a lengthy period when some crops were deliberately planted and other foods were gathered from the wild although localised climate change is the favoured explanation for the origins of agriculture in the levant the fact that farming was invented at least three times possibly more suggests that social reasons may have been instrumental

dependency on domestic crops and animals i e when wild resources contributed a nutritionally insignificant component to the diet was not until the bronze age if the operative definition of agriculture includes large scale intensive cultivation of land mono cropping organised irrigation and use of a specialized labour force the title inventors of agriculture would fall to the sumerians starting ca five five zero zero bc intensive farming allows a much greater density of population than can be supported by hunting and gathering and allows for the accumulation of excess product to keep for winter use or to sell for profit the ability of farmers to feed large numbers of people whose activities have nothing to do with material production was the crucial factor in the rise of standing armies the agriculturalism of the sumerians allowed them to embark on an unprecedented territorial expansion making them the first empire builders not long after the egyptians powered by effective farming of the nile valley achieved a population density from which enough warriors could be drawn for a territorial expansion more than tripling the sumerian empire in area the invention of a three field system of crop rotation during the middle ages vastly improved agricultural efficiency after one four nine two the world s agricultural patterns were shuffled in the widespread exchange of plants and animals known as the columbian exchange crops and animals that were previously only known in the old world were now transplanted to the new and vice versa perhaps most notably the tomato became a favorite in european cuisine while certain wheat strains quickly took to western hemisphere soils and became a dietary staple even for native north central and south americans by the early one eight zero zero s agricultural practices particularly careful selection of hardy strains and cultivars had so improved that yield per land unit was many times that seen in the middle ages and before especially in the largely virgin lands of north and south america with the rapid rise of mechanization in the two zero th century especially in the form of the tractor the demanding tasks of sowing harvesting and threshing could be performed with a speed and on a scale barely imaginable before these advances have led to efficiencies enabling certain modern farms in the united states argentina israel germany

two six one eight nine four november two two one nine six three was a british writer who emigrated to the united states he was a member of the famous huxley family who produced a number of brilliant scientific minds best known for his novels and wide ranging output of essays he also published short stories poetry travel writing and film stories and scripts through his novels and essays huxley functioned as an examiner and sometimes critic of social mores societal norms and ideals and possible misapplications of science in human life while his earlier concerns might be called humanist ultimately he became quite interested in spiritual subjects like parapsychology and mystically based philosophy which he also wrote about by the end of his life huxley was considered in certain circles a leader of modern thought biography early years family tree huxley was born in godalming surrey england he was the son of the writer leonard huxley by his first wife julia arnold and grandson of thomas henry huxley one of the most important naturalists of the one nine th century a man known as darwin s bulldog his brother julian huxley was a biologist also noted for his evolutionary theories huxley understandably excelled in the areas he took up professionally for on his father s side were a number of noted men of science while on his mother s were people of literary accomplishment huxley was a lanky delicately framed child who was gifted intellectually his father was a professional herbalist as well as an author so aldous began his learning in his father s well equipped botanical laboratory then continued in a school named hillside which his mother supervised for several years until she became terminally ill from the age of nine aldous was then educated in the british boarding school system he took readily to the handling of ideas his mother julia died in one nine zero eight when aldous was only fourteen and his sister roberta died of an unrelated incident in the same month three years later aldous suffered an illness keratitis punctata which seriously damaged his eyesight his older brother trev committed suicide in one nine one four aldous s near blindness disqualified him from service in world war i once his eyesight recovered he was able to read english literature at balliol college oxford where he was a member of the cambridge apostles maturing as a lean young man well over six feet in height the cerebrotonic huxley s initial interest in literature was primarily intellectual while he was noted for his personal kindliness only considerably later some say under the influence of such friends as d h lawrence did he heartily embrace feelings as matters of importance in his evolving personal philosophy and literary expression following his education at balliol huxley was financially indebted to his father and had to earn a living for a short while in one nine one eight he was employed acquiring provisions at the air ministry but never desiring a career in administration or in business huxley s lack of inherited means propelled him into applied literary work huxley had completed his first unpublished novel at the age of seventeen and began writing seriously in his early twenties he wrote great novels on dehumanising aspects of scientific progress most famously brave new world and on pacifist themes e g eyeless in gaza huxley was strongly influenced by f matthias alexander and included him as a character in eyeless in gaza middle years already a noted satirist and social thinker during world war i huxley spent much of his time at garsington manor home of lady ottoline morrell later in crome yellow one nine two one he caricatured the garsington lifestyle he married maria nys whom he had met at garsington they had one child matthew who grew up to be an epidemiologist huxley moved to hollywood california in one nine three seven with his wife and friend gerald heard heard introduced huxley to vedanta and meditating in huxley s one nine three seven book ends and means most people in modern civilization agree that they want a world of liberty peace justice and brotherly love though they haven t been able to agree on how to achieve it his book goes on to explore why the confusion or disagreement is there and what might be done about it in one nine three eight huxley befriended j krishnamurti whose teachings he greatly admired he also became a vedantist in the circle of swami prabhavananda and he also introduced christopher isherwood to this circle not long after huxley wrote his book on widely held spiritual values and ideas the perennial philosophy which discussed teachings of the world s great mystics for most of his life since the illness in his teens which left huxley nearly blind his eyesight was poor despite the partial recovery which had enabled him to study at oxford around one nine three nine he heard of the bates method for natural vision improvement and of a teacher margaret corbett who was able to teach him in the method he claimed his sight improved dramatically as a result of using the method then later wrote a book about it the art of seeing which was published in one nine four two us one nine four three uk he reported that for the first time in over two five years he was able to read without spectacles and without strain he was a screenwriter for the one nine four zero production of pride and prejudice later years after world war ii huxley applied for united states citizenship but was denied because he would not say he would take up arms to defend america he became a vegetarian thereafter his works were strongly influenced by mysticism and his experiences with the hallucinogenic drug mescaline to which he was introduced by the psychiatrist humphry osmond in one nine five three his years on psychoactive drugs were described as a paradise washed down with bourbon generally he was a pioneer of self directed psychedelic drug use in a search for enlightenment famously taking one zero zero micrograms of lsd as he lay dying huxley s psychedelic drug experiences are described in the essays the doors of perception the title deriving from some lines in the book the marriage of heaven and hell by william blake and heaven and hell the title of the former became the inspiration for the naming of the rock band the doors some of his writings on psychedelics became frequent reading among early hippies huxley s main interest was not in just anything vague mysterious or subjective but in what is sometimes termed higher mysticism he liked the term perennial philosophy that he used as the title of his noted book on the topic during the one nine five zero s huxley s interest in the related field of psychical research grew keener huxley s wife maria died of breast cancer in one nine five five and in one nine five six he remarried to laura archera who was herself an author and who wrote a biography of aldous in one nine six zero huxley was diagnosed with throat cancer in the years that followed with his health deteriorating he wrote the utopian novel island and gave lectures on human potentialities at the esalen institute in one nine five nine huxley who remained a british citizen turned down an offer of a knight bachelor by the macmillan government his ideas were foundational to the forming of the human potential movement he was also invited to speak at several prestigious american universities at a speech given in one nine six one at the california medical school in san francisco huxley warned there will be in the next generation or so a pharmacological method of making people love their servitude and producing dictatorship without tears so to speak producing a kind of painless concentration camp for entire societies so that people will in fact have their liberties taken away from them but will rather enjoy it an idea not dissimilar to his contemporary writer j b priestley s idea in the magicians huxley s views on the proper roles of science and technology as he portrayed these say in island are akin to some other noted english and american thinkers of the twentieth century such as lewis mumford and huxley s friend gerald heard and in some ways buckminster fuller and e f schumacher clearly these men found descendants in some significant movers of a younger generation e g stewart brand via gerald heard huxley was introduced to the young huston smith who went on to become a prolific and famous scholar on the religions of man the two friends acquianted smith with vedanta and meditative practice later while huxley was a guest professor at m i t he made introductions between smith and timothy leary that lead to epiphanies smith covers in his later book cleansing of the doors of perception amongst humanists huxley was considered an intellectual s intellectual although his financial circumstances had forced him to churn out articles and books his thinking and best writing earned him an exalted esteem his books were frequently on the required reading lists of english and modern philosophy courses in american colleges and universities he was one of the twentieth century thinkers honoured in the scribners publishing s leaders of modern thought series a volume of biography and literary criticism by philip thody aldous huxley death and afterwards on his deathbed unable to speak he made a written request to his wife for lsd one zero zero g i m she obliged and he died peacefully the following morning november two two one nine six three media coverage of his death was overshadowed by news of the assassination of president john f kennedy which occurred on the same day as did the death of the irish author c s lewis in all of huxley s mature writings one finds an awareness that seems to bridge the gap between the two cultures the sciences and the humanities this gulf posed a potentially enormous problem one that was recognized by other thinkers during huxley s lifetime such as c p snow the interest among professors of humanities and liberal arts in huxley s work both during the writer s lifetime and afterwards rests on this consciousness on the part of the author and of course on the artful and often humorous way in which he expressed himself huxley s satirical dystopian and utopian novels seldom fail to stimulate thought the same may be said for his essays and essay collections perhaps his main message is the tragedy that frequently follows from egocentrism self centredness and selfishness films huxley wrote many screenplays and many of his novels were later adapted for film or television notable works include the original screenplay for disney s animated alice in wonderland two productions of brave new world one of point counter point one of eyeless in gaza and one of ape and essence he was one of the screenwriters for the one nine four zero version of pride and prejudice and co wrote the screenplay for the one nine four four

laurencia up close the branches are multicellular and only about one mm thick much smaller algae are seen growing attached to the structure extending upwards in the lower right quarter algae singular alga encompass several different groups of living organisms that capture light energy through photosynthesis converting inorganic substances into simple sugars using the captured energy algae have been traditionally regarded as simple plants and some are closely related to the higher plants others appear to represent different protist groups alongside other organisms that are traditionally considered more animal like that is protozoa thus algae do not represent a single evolutionary direction or line but a level of organization that may have developed several times in the early history of life on earth algae range from single celled organisms to multi cellular organisms some with fairly complex differentiated form and if marine called seaweeds all lack leaves roots flowers and other organ structures that characterize higher plants they are distinguished from other protozoa in that they are photoautotrophic although this is not a hard and fast distinction as some groups contain members that are mixotrophic deriving energy both from photosynthesis and uptake of organic carbon either by osmotrophy myzotrophy or phagotrophy some unicellular species rely entirely on external energy sources and have reduced or lost their photosynthetic apparatus all algae have photosynthetic machinery ultimately derived from the cyanobacteria and so produce oxygen as a by product of photosynthesis unlike non cyanobacterial photosynthetic bacteria algae are usually found in damp places or bodies of water and thus are common in terrestrial as well as aquatic environments however terrestrial algae are usually rather inconspicuous and far more common in moist tropical regions than dry ones because algae lack vascular tissues and other adaptions to live on land algae can endure dryness and other conditions in symbiosis with a fungus as lichen the various sorts of algae play significant roles in aquatic ecology microscopic forms that live suspended in the water column called phytoplankton provide the food base for most marine food chains in very high densities so called algal blooms these algae may discolor the water and outcompete or poison other life forms seaweeds grow mostly in shallow marine waters some are used as human food or harvested for useful substances such as agar or fertilizer the study of algae is called phycology or algology relationships among algal groups prokaryotic algae traditionally the cyanobacteria have been included among the algae referred to as the cyanophytes or blue green algae the term algae refers to any aquatic organisms capable of photosynthesis though some recent treatises on algae specifically exclude them cyanobacteria are some of the oldest organisms to appear in the fossil record dating back about three eight billion years precambrian ancient cyanobacteria likely produced much of the oxygen in the earth s atmosphere cyanobacteria can be unicellular colonial or filamentous they have a prokaryotic cell structure typical of bacteria and conduct photosynthesis directly within the cytoplasm rather than in specialized organelles some filamentous blue green algae have specialized cells termed heterocysts in which nitrogen fixation occurs eukaryotic algae all other algae are eukaryotes and conduct photosynthesis within membrane bound structures organelles called chloroplasts chloroplasts contain dna and are similar in structure to cyanobacteria presumably representing reduced cyanobacterial endosymbionts the exact nature of the chloroplasts is different among the different lines of algae reflecting different endosymbiotic events there are three groups archaeplastida that have primary chloroplasts green algae together with higher plants red algae glaucophytes in these groups the chloroplast is surrounded by two membranes and probably developed through a single endosymbiosis the chloroplasts of red algae have a more or less typical cyanobacterial pigmentation while those of the green alga have chloroplasts with chlorophyll a and b the latter found in some cyanobacteria and not most higher plants are pigmented similarly to green algae and probably developed from them two other groups of algae have green chloroplasts containing chlorophyll b euglenids and chlorarachniophytes these are surrounded by three and four membranes respectively and were probably retained from an ingested green alga those of the chlorarchniophytes contain a small nucleomorph which is the remnant of the alga s nucleus it has been suggested that the euglenid chloroplasts only have three membranes because they were acquired through myzocytosis rather than phagocytosis the remaining algae all have chloroplasts containing chlorophylls a and c the latter chlorophyll type is not known from any prokaryotes or primary chloroplasts but genetic similarities with the red algae suggest a relationship there these groups include heterokonts e g golden algae diatoms brown algae haptophytes e g coccolithophores cryptomonads dinoflagellates in the first three of these groups chromista the chloroplast has four membranes retaining a nucleomorph in cryptomonads and they likely share a common pigmented ancestor the typical dinoflagellate chloroplast has three membranes but there is considerable diversity in chloroplasts among the group as some members have acquired theirs from different sources the apicomplexa a group of closely related parasites also have plastids though not actual chloroplasts which appear to have a common origin with those of the dinoflagellates note many of these groups contain some members that are no longer photosynthetic some retain plastids but not chloroplasts while others have lost them entirely forms of algae most of the simpler algae are unicellular flagellates or amoeboids but colonial and non motile forms have developed independently among several of the groups some of the more common organizational levels more than one of which may occur in the life cycle of a species are colonial small regular groups of motile cells capsoid individual non motile cells embedded in mucilage coccoid individual non motile cells with cell walls palmelloid non motile cells embedded in mucilage filamentous a string of non motile cells connected together sometimes branching parenchymatous cells forming a thallus with partial differentiation of tissues in three lines even higher levels of organization have been reached leading to organisms with full tissue differentiation these are the brown algae some of which may reach seven zero m in length kelps the red algae and the green algae the most complex forms are found among the green algae see charales in a lineage that eventually led to the higher land plants the point where these non algal plants begin and algae stop is usually taken to be the presence of reproductive organs with protective cell layers a characteristic not found in the other alga groups algae and symbioses some species of algae form symbiotic relationships with other organisms in these symbioses the algae supply photosynthates organic substances to the host organism providing protection to the algal cells the host organism derives some or all of its energy requirements from the alga examples include lichens a fungus is the host usually with a green alga or a cyanobacterium as its symbiont both fungal and algal species found in lichens are capable of living independently although habitat requirements may be greatly different from those of the lichen pair corals algae known as zooxanthellae are symbionts with corals notable amongst these is the dinoflagellate symbiodinium found in many hard corals the loss of symbiodinium or other zooxanthellae from the host is known as coral bleaching sponges uses of algae algae are used by man in a great many ways because many species are aquatic and microscopic they are cultured in clear tanks or ponds and either harvested or used to treat effluents pumped through the ponds algae culture on a large scale is an important type of aquaculture in some places energy source algae can be used to produce biodiesel see algae culture and by some estimates can produce vastly superior amounts of oil compared to terrestrial crops grown for the same purpose because algae grown to produce biodiesel does not need to meet the requirements of a food crop it is much cheaper to produce also it does not need fresh water or fertilizer both of which are quite expensive algae can be grown to produce hydrogen in one nine three nine a german researcher named hans gaffron while working at the university of chicago observed that the algae he was studying chlamydomonas reinhardtii a green algae would sometimes switch from the production of oxygen to the production of hydrogen gaffron never discovered the cause for this change and for many years other scientists failed in their attempts at its discovery in the late one nine nine zero s professor anastasios melis a researcher at the university of california at berkeley discovered that if you deprive the algae of sulfur it will switch from the production of oxygen normal photosynthesis to the production of hydrogen he found that the enzyme responsible for this reaction is hydrogenase but that the hydrogenase will not cause this switch in the pressence of oxygen melis found that depleting the amount of sulfur available to the algae interrupted its internal oxygen flow allowing the hydrogenase an environment in which it can react causing the algae to produce hydrogen chlamydomonas moeweesi is also a good strain for the production of hydrogen algae can be grown to produce biomass which can be burned to produce heat and electricity pmb berkeley edu pollution control algae are used in wastewater treatment facilities reducing the need for more dangerous chemicals algae can be used to capture fertilizers in runoff from farms if this algae is then harvested it itself can be used as fertilizer algae are used by some powerplants to reduce co two emissions the co two is pumped into a pond or some kind of tank on which the algae feed nutritional value of algae algae is commercially cultivated as a nutritional supplement one of the most popular microalgal species is spirulina arthrospira platensis which is a cyanobacteria known as blue green algae and has been hailed by some as a superfood other algal species cultivated for their nutritional value include chlorella a green algae and dunaliella dunaliella salina which is high in beta carotene and is used in vitamin c supplements algae is sometimes also used as a food as in the chinese vegetable known as fat choy which is actually a cyanobacterium the oil from some algae have high levels of unsaturated fatty

anova is a collection of statistical models and their associated procedures which compare means by splitting the overall observed variance into different parts the initial techniques of the analysis of variance were pioneered by the statistician and geneticist ronald fisher in the one nine two zero s and one nine three zero s and is sometimes known as fisher s anova or fisher s analysis of variance overview there are three conceptual classes of such models fixed effects model assumes that the data come from normal populations which differ in their means random effects models assume that the data describe a hierarchy of different populations whose differences are constrained by the hierarchy mixed models describe situations where both fixed and random effects are present the fundamental technique is a partitioning of the total sum of squares into components related to the effects in the model used for example we show the model for a simplified anova with one type of treatment at different levels if the treatment levels are quantitative and the effects are linear a linear regression analysis may be appropriate ss ss ss the number of degrees of freedom abbreviated df can be partitioned in a similar way and specifies the chi square distribution which describes the associated sums of squares df df df fixed effects model the fixed effects model of analysis of variance applies to situations in which the experimenter has subjected his experimental material to several treatments each of which affects only the mean of the underlying normal distribution of the response variable random effects model random effects models are used to describe situations in which incomparable differences in experimental material occur the simplest example is that of estimating the unknown mean of a population whose individuals differ from each other in this case the variation between individuals is confounded with that of the observing instrument degrees of freedom degrees of freedom indicates the effective number of observations which contribute to the sum of squares in an anova the total number of observations minus the number of linear constraints in the data tests

duncan s new multiple range test external links analysis of variance sixsigmafirst statistics for saturated hydrocarbons containing one or more rings see cycloalkane an alkane in organic chemistry is a saturated hydrocarbon without cycles that is an acyclic hydrocarbon in which the molecule has the maximum possible number of hydrogen atoms and so has no double bonds alkanes are aliphatic compounds the general formula for alkanes is cnh two n two the simplest possible alkane is therefore methane ch four the next simplest is ethane c two h six the series continues indefinitely each carbon atom in an alkane has sp hybridization alkanes are also known as paraffins or collectively as the paraffin series these terms also used for alkanes whose carbon atoms form a single unbranched chain such branched chain alkanes are called isoparaffins isomerism the atoms in alkanes with more than three carbon atoms can be arranged in multiple ways forming different isomers normal alkanes have a linear unbranched configuration the number of isomers increases rapidly with the number of carbon atoms for alkanes with one to one two carbon atoms the number of isomers equals one one one two three five nine one eight three five seven five one five nine and three five five respectively nomenclature of alkanes the names of all alkanes end with ane alkanes with unbranched carbon chains the first four members of the series in terms of number of carbon atoms are named as follows methane ch four ethane c two h six propane c three h eight butane c four h one zero alkanes with five or more carbon atoms are named by adding the suffix ane to the appropriate numerical multiplier with elision of a terminal a from the basic numerical term hence pentane c five h one two hexane c six h one four heptane c seven h one six octane c eight h one eight etc for a more complete list see list of alkanes straight chain alkanes are sometimes indicated by the prefix n for normal to distinguish them from branched chain alkanes having the same number of carbon atoms although this is not strictly necessary the usage is still common in cases where there is an important difference in properties between the straight chain and branched chain isomers e g n hexane is a neurotoxin while its branched chain isomers are not alkanes with branched carbon chains branched alkanes are named as follows identify the longest straight chain of carbon atoms number the atoms in this chain starting from one at one end and counting upwards to the other end examine the groups attached to the chain in order and form their names form the name by looking at the different attached groups and writing for each group the following the number or numbers of the carbon atom or atoms where it is attached the prefixes di tri tetra etc if the group is attached in two three four etc places or nothing if it is attached in only one place the name of the attached group the formation of the name is finished by writing down the name of the longest straight chain to carry out this algorithm we must know how to name the substituent groups this is done by the same method except that instead of the longest chain of carbon atoms the longest chain starting from the attachment point is used also the numbering is done so that the carbon atom next to the attachment point has the number one for example the compound is the only four carbon alkane possible apart from butane its formal name is two methylpropane pentane however has two branched isomers in addition to its linear normal form two two dimethylpropane and two methylbutane trivial names the following nonsystematic names are retained in the iupac system isobutane for two methylpropane isopentane for two methylbutane neopentane for two two dimethylpropane the name isooctane is very widely used in the petrochemical industry to refer to two two four trimethylpentane occurrence methane and ethane make up a large proportion of jupiter s atmosphere alkanes occur both on earth and in the solar system however only the first hundred or so and even then mostly only in traces the light hydrocarbons especially methane and ethane for example have been detected both in the tail of the comet hyakutake and in some meteorites such as carbonaceous chondrites they also form an important portion of the atmospheres of the outer gas planets jupiter saturn uranus and neptune on titan the satellite of saturn it is believed that there were once large oceans of these and longer chain alkanes smaller seas of liquid ethane are thought still to exist there traces of methane about zero zero zero zero one or one ppm occur in the earth s atmosphere produced primarily by forms of archaea the content in the oceans is negligible due to the low solubility in water however at high pressures and low temperatures methane can co crystallize with water to form a solid methane hydrate although they cannot be commercially exploited at the present time the calorific value of the known methane hydrate fields exceeds the energy content of all the natural gas and oil deposits put together methane extracted from methane hydrate is considered therefore a candidate for future fuels extraction of alkanes in ontario today the most important commercial sources for alkanes are clearly natural gas and oil which are the only organic compounds to occur as minerals in nature natural gas contains primarily methane and ethane with some propane and butane oil is a mixture of liquid alkanes and other hydrocarbons both were formed when dead marine animals and plants zooplankton and phytoplankton sank to the bottom of ancient seas and were covered with sediments in an anoxic environment ie lacking in oxygen and converted over many millions of years at high temperatures and high pressure to their current form natural gas resulted thereby for example from the following reaction c six h one two o six three ch four three co two these hydrocarbons collected in porous rocks trapped beneath an impermeable cap rock in contrast to methane which is constantly reformed in large quantities higher alkanes rarely develop to a considerable extent in nature the present deposits will not be reformed once they are exhausted solid alkanes occur as evaporation residues from oil known as tar one of the largest natural deposits of solid alkanes is in the asphalt lake known as the pitch lake in trinidad and tobago purification and use an oil refinery at martinez california alkanes are both important raw materials of the chemical industry and the most important fuels of the world economy the starting materials for the processing are always natural gas and crude oil the latter is separated in an oil refinery by fractional distillation and processed into many different products for example gasoline the different fractions of crude oil have different boiling points and can be isolated and separated quite easily within the individual fractions the boiling points lie closely together the domain of usage of a certain alkane can be determined quite well according to the number of carbon atoms although the following demarcation is idealized and not perfect the first four alkanes are used mainly for heating and cooking purposes and in some countries for electricity generation methane and ethane are the main componants of natural gas they are normally stored as gases under pressure it is however easier to transport them as liquids this requires both compression and cooling of the gas propane and butane can be liquefied at fairly low pressures and are well known as liquified petroleum gas lpg propane for example is used in the propane gas burner butane in disposable cigarette lighters where the pressure is a mere two bar the two alkanes are used as propellants in aerosol sprays from pentane to octane the alkanes are highly volatile liquids they are used as fuels in internal combustion engines as they vaporise easily on entry into the combustion chamber without forming droplets which would impair the unifomity of the combustion branched chain alkanes are preferred as they are much less prone to premature ignition which causes knocking than their straight chain homologues this propensity to premature ignition is measured by the octane rating of the fuel where two two four trimethylpentane isooctane has an arbitrary value of one zero zero and heptane has a value of zero apart from their use as fuels the middle alkanes are also good solvents for nonpolar substances alkanes from nonane to for instance hexadecane an alkane with sixteen carbon atoms are liquids of higher viscosity less and less suitable for use in gasoline they form instead the major part of diesel and aviation fuel diesel fuels are charaterised by their cetane number cetane being an old name for hexadecane however the higher melting points of these alkanes can cause problems at low temperatures and in polar regions where the fuel becomes too thick to flow correctly alkanes from hexadecane upwards form the most important components of fuel oil and lubricating oil in latter function they work at the same time as anti corrosive agents as their hydrophobic nature means that water cannot reach the metal surface many solid alkanes find use as paraffin wax for example in candles this should not be confused however with true wax which consists primarily of esters alkanes with a chain length of approximately three five or more carbon atoms are found in bitumen used for example in road surfacing however the higher alkanes have little value and are usually split into lower alkanes by cracking preparation numerous ways exist to prepare alkanes in the laboratory the most well known methods are hydrogenation of alkenes and hydrolysis of grignard reagents alkanes can also be prepared directly from alkyl halides in the corey house posner whitesides reaction the barton mccombie deoxygenation removes hydroxyl groups from alcohols and the clemmensen reduction removes carbonyl groups from aldehydes and ketones to form alkanes molecular geometry sp three hybridisation in methane the molecular structure of the alkanes directly affects their physical and chemical characteristics it is derived from the electron configuration of carbon which has four valence electrons the carbon atoms in alkanes are always sp three hybridised that is to say that the valence electrons are said to be in four equivalent orbitals derived from the combination of the two s orbital and the three two p orbitals these orbitals which have identical energies are arranged spatially in the form of a tetrahedron the angle of one zero nine four seven between them bond lengths and bond angles an alkane molecule has only c h and c c single bonds the former result from the overlap of a sp orbital of carbon with the one s orbital of a hydrogen the latter by the overlap of two sp orbitals on different carbon atoms the bond lengths amount to one zero nine one zero one zero m for a c h bond and one five four one zero one zero m for a c c bond the tetrahedral structure of methane the spatial arrangement of the bonds is similar to that of the four sp orbitals they are tetrahedrally arranged with an angle of one zero nine four seven between them structural formulae which represent the bonds as being at right angles to one another while both common and useful do not correspond with the reality conformation the structural formula and the bond angles are not usually sufficient to completely describe the geometry of a molecule there is a further degree of freedom for each carbon carbon bond the torsion angle between the atoms or groups bound to the atoms at each end of the bond the spatial arrangement described by the torsion angles of the molecule is known as its conformation ethane ethane forms the simplest case for studying the conformation of alkanes as there is only one c c bond if one looks down the axis of the c c bond then one will see the so called newman projection the circle represents the two carbon atoms one behind the other and the bonds to hydrogen are represented by the straight lines the hydrogen atoms on both the front and rear carbon atoms have an angle of one two zero between them resulting from the projection of the base of the tetrahedron onto a flat plane however the torsion angle between a given hydrogen atom attached to the front carbon and a given hydrogen atom attached to the rear carbon can vary freely between zero and three six zero this is a consequence of the free rotation about a carbon carbon single bond despite this apparent freedom only two limiting conformations are important newman projections of the two conformations of ethane eclipsed on the left staggered on the right in the eclipsed conformation corresponding to a torsion angle of zero one two zero or two four zero the hydrogen atoms attached to the front carbon are directly in front of those attached to the rear carbon in the staggered conformation corresponding to a torsion angle of six zero one eight zero or three zero zero the hydrogen atoms attached to the front carbon are exactly in between those attached to the rear carbon the two conformations also known as rotomers differ in energy the staggered conformation is one two six kj mol lower in energy more stable than the eclipsed conformation the explanation for this difference in energy has been the subject of debate with two main theories predominating in the eclipsed conformation the electrostatic repulsion between the electrons in the carbon hydrogen bonds is maximised in the staggered conformation the hyperconjugation a form of delocalisation of the valence electrons is maximised these two explanations are not contradictory or exclusive the latter is thought to be the more important for ethane itself this difference in energy between the two conformations known as the torsion energy is low compared to the thermal energy of an ethane molecule at ambient temperature there is constant rotation about the c c bond albeit with short pauses at each staggered conformation the time taken for an ethane molecule to pass from one staggered conformation to the next equivalent to the rotation of one ch three group by one two zero relative to the other is of the order of one zero one one seconds higher alkanes the four conformations of butane from left to right fully eclipsed inclined partially eclipsed antiperiplanar the situation with respect to the two c c bonds in propane is qualitatively similar to that of ethane it is more complex however for butane and higher alkanes if one takes the central c c bond of butane as the reference axis each of the two central carbon atoms is bound to two hydrogen atoms and a methyl group four different conformations can be defined by the torsion angle between the two methyl groups and as in the case of ethane each has its characteristic energy the fully eclipsed or synperiplanar conformation has a torsion angle of zero it is the configuration with the highest energy the inclined conformation has a torsion angle of six zero or three zero zero it is a local energy minimum the partially eclipsed conformation has a torsion angle of one two zero or two four zero it is a local energy maximum the antiperiplanar conformation has a torsion angle of one eight zero the two methyl groups are as far from each other as is possible and this configuration has the lowest energy the difference in energy between the fully eclipsed conformation and the antiperiplanar conformation is about one nine kj mol and is therefore still relatively small at ambient temperature the case of higher alkanes is similar the antiperiplanar conformation is always the most favoured around each carbon carbon bond for this reason alkanes are usually shown in a zigzag arrangement in diagrams or in models the actual structure will always differ somewhat from these idealised forms as the differences in energy between the conformations are small compared to the thermal energy of the molecules alkane molecules have no fixed structural form whatever the models may suggest the conformations of other organic molecules are based on those of alkanes and are discussed in the relevant articles properties physical properties melting blue and boiling pink points of the first one four n alkanes in c the molecular structure particularly the surface area of the molecule determines the boiling point of the alkane the smaller the surface the lower the boiling point as the van der waals forces between the molecules are weaker a reduction of the surface area can be achieved by chain branching or by a circular structure this means in practice that alkanes with higher number of carbon atoms usually have higher boiling points than those with lower numbers of carbon atoms and that branched chain alkanes and cycloalkanes have lower boiling points than their straight chain homologues under standard conditions from ch four to c four h one zero alkanes are gaseous from c five h one two to c one seven h three six they are liquids and after c one eight h three eight they are solids the boiling point increases between two zero and three zero c per ch two group the melting points of the alkanes also rise with the increase in the number of carbon atoms with only one exception propane however the melting points rise more slowly than the boiling points in particular for the higher alkanes in addition the melting points of alkanes with an odd number of carbon atoms increase faster than the melting points of alkanes with an even number of carbon atoms see figure the cause of this phenomenon is the higher packing density of the alkanes with an even number of carbon atoms the melting points of branched chain alkanes can be either higher or lower than those of the corresponding straight chain alkanes depending on the efficiency of molecular packing this is particularly true for isoalkanes two methyl isomers which often have melting points higher than those of their normal analogues alkanes do not conduct electricity nor are they substantially polarized by an electric field for this reason they do not form hydrogen bonds and are insoluble in polar solvents such as water since the hydrogen bonds between individual water molecules are aligned away from an alkane molecule the coexistance of an alkane and water leads to an increase in molecular order a reduction in entropy as there is no significant bonding between water molecules and alkane molecules the second law of thermodynamics suggests that this reduction in entropy should be minimised by minimising the contact between alkane and water alkanes are said to be hydrophobic in that they repel water their solubility in nonpolar solvents is relatively good a property which is called lipophilicity different alkanes are for example miscible in all proportions among themselves the density of the alkanes usually increases with increasing number of carbon atoms but remains less than that of water hence alkanes form the upper layer in an alkane water mixture chemical properties alkanes generally show a relatively low reactivity because their c h and c c bonds are relatively stable and cannot be easily broken unlike all other organic compounds they possess no functional groups they react only very poorly with ionic or other polar substances the p k a values of all alkanes are above six zero and so they are practically inert to acids and bases this inertness is the source of the term paraffins latin para affinis with the meaning here of lacking affinity in crude oil the alkane molecules have remained chemically unchanged for millions of years however redox reactions of alkanes in particular with oxygen and the halogens are possible as the carbon atoms are in a strongly reduced condition in the case of methane the lowest possible oxidation state for carbon four is reached reaction with oxygen leads to combustion with halogens substitution in addition alkanes have been shown to interact with and bind to certain transition metal complexes free radicals molecules with unpaired electrons play a large role in most reactions of alkanes such as cracking and reformation where long chain alkanes are converted into shorter chain alkanes and straight chain alkanes into branched chain isomers in highly brached alkanes the bond angles may differ significantly from the optimal value one zero nine five in order to allow the different groups sufficient space this causes a tension in the molecule known as steric hinderance and can substantially increase the reactivity thermochemistry alkanes are stable molecules relative to their constituent elements which is manifested as a negative heat of formation for linear alkanes each methylene ch two unit contributes five kcal mol to the overal heat of formation branched alkanes are always a little bit more stable than their linear isomers for example two methylbutane is more stable than n pentane by one eight kcal mol and two two methylpropane is more stable than n pentane by five kcal mol see the alkane heat of formation table for detailed data spectroscopic properties virtually all organic compounds contain carbon carbon and carbon hydrogen bonds and so show some of the features of alkanes in their spectra alkanes are notable for having no other groups and therefore for the absence of other characreistic spectroscopic features infrared spectroscopy the carbon hydrogen stretching mode gives a strong absorption between two eight five zero and two nine six zero cm one while the carbon carbon stretching mode absorbes between eight zero zero and one three zero zero cm one the carbon hydrogen bending modes depend on the nature of the group methyl groups show bands at one four five zero cm one and one three seven five cm one while methylene groups show bands at one four six five cm one and one four five zero cm one carbon chains with more than four carbon atoms show a weak absorption at around seven two five cm one nmr spectroscopy the proton resonances of alkanes are usually found at h zero one the carbon one three resonances depend on the number of hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon c eight three zero methyl one five five five methylene two zero six zero methyne the carbon one three resonance of quaternary carbon atoms is characteristically weak due to the lack of nuclear overhauser enhancement and the long relaxation time it can be missed in routine spectra mass spectrometry alkanes have a high ionisation energy and the molecular ion is usually weak the fragmentation pattern can be difficult to interpret but in the case of branched chain alkanes the carbon chain is preferentially cleaved at tertiary or quaternary carbons due to the relative stability of the resulting free radicals the fragment resulting from the loss of a single methyl group m one five is often absent and other fragment are often spaced by intervals of fourteen mass units corresponding to sequential loss of ch two groups reactions reactions with oxygen all alkanes react with oxygen in a combustion reaction although they become increasing difficult to ignite as the number of carbon atoms increases the general equation for complete combustion is two c n h two n two three n one o two two n one h two o two n co two in the absence of sufficient oxygen carbon monoxide or even soot can be formed as shown below for methane two ch four three o two two co four h two o ch four o two c two h two o alkanes usually burn with a non luminous flame with very little soot formation the standard enthalpy change of combustion c h o for alkanes increases by about six five zero kj mol per ch two group branched chain alkanes have lower values of c h o than straight chain alkanes of the same number of carbon atoms and so can be seen to be somewhat more stable reactions with halogens alkanes react with halogens in a so called halogenation reaction the hydrogen atoms of the alkane are progressively replaced or substituted by halogen atoms free radicals are the reactive species which participate in the reaction which usually leads to a mixture of products the reaction is highly exothermic and can lead to an explosion the chain mechanism is as follows using the chlorination of methane as a typical example one initiation splitting of a chlorine molecule to form two chlorine atoms initiated by ultraviolet radiation a chlorine atom has an unpaired electron and acts as a free radical cl two two cl two propagation two steps a hydrogen atom is pulled off from methane then the methyl radical pulls a cl from cl two ch four cl ch three hcl ch three cl two ch three cl cl this results in the desired product plus another chlorine radical this radical will then go on to take part in another propagation reaction causing a chain reaction if there is sufficient chlorine other products such as ch two cl two may be formed three termination recombination of two free radicals cl cl cl two or ch three cl ch three cl or ch three ch three c two h six the last possibility in the termination step will result in an impurity in the final mixture notably this results in an organic molecule with a longer carbon chain than the reactants in the case of methane or ethane all the hydrogen atoms are equivalent and have an equal chance of being replaced this leads to what is known as a statistical product distribution for propane and higher alkanes the hydrogen atoms which form part of ch two or ch groups are preferentially replaced the reactivity of the different halogens varies considerably the relative rates are fluorine one zero eight chlorine one bromine seven one zero one one iodine two one zero two two hence the reaction of alkanes with fluorine is difficult to control that with chlorine is moderate to fast that with bromine is slow and requires high levels of uv irradiation while the reaction with iodine is practically non existent and thermodynamically unfavorable these reactions are an important industrial route to halogenated hydrocarbons cracking and reforming cracking breaks larger molecules into smaller ones this can be done with a thermic or catalytic method the thermal cracking process follows a homolytic mechanism that is bonds break symmetrically and thus pairs of free radicals are formed the catalytic cracking process involves the presence of acid catalysts usually solid acids such as silica alumina and zeolites which promote a heterolytic asymmetric breakage of bonds yielding pairs of ions of opposite charges usually a carbocation and the very unstable hydride anion carbon localized free radicals and cations are both highly unstable and undergo processes of chain rearrangement c c scission in position beta i e cracking and intra and intermolecular hydrogen transfer or hydride transfer in both types of processes the corresponding reactive intermediates radicals ions are permanently regenerated and thus they proceed by a self propagating chain mechanism the chain of reactions is eventually terminated by radical or ion recombination here is an example of cracking with butane ch three ch two ch two ch three one st possibility four eight breaking is done on the ch three ch two bond ch three ch two ch two ch three after a certain number of steps we will obtain an alkane and an alkene ch four ch two ch ch three two nd possibility three eight breaking is done on the ch two ch two bond ch three ch two ch two ch

number of steps we will obtain an alkene and hydrogen gas ch two ch ch two ch three h two other reactions alkanes will react with steam in the presence of a nickel catalyst to give hydrogen alkanes can by chlorosulfonated and nitrated although both reactions require special conditions the fermentation of alkanes to carboxylic acids is of some technical importance in the reed reaction sulfur dioxide chlorine and light convert hydrocarbons to sulfonyl chlorides hazards methane is explosive in when mixed with air one eight ch four and is a strong greenhouse gas other lower alkanes can also form explosive mixtures with air the lighter liquid alkanes are highly flammable although this risk decreases with the length of the carbon chain pentane hexane heptane and octane are classed as dangerous for the environment and harmful the straight chain isomer of hexane is a neurotoxin and therefore rarely used commercially alkanes in nature although alkanes occur in nature in various way they do not rank biologically among the essential materials cycloalkanes with one four to one eight carbon atoms occur in musk extracted from deer of the family moschidae all further information refers to acyclic alkanes bacteria and archaea methanogenic archaea in the gut of this cow are responsible for some of the methane in the earth s atmosphere certain types of bacteria can metabolise alkanes they prefer even numbered carbon chains as they are easier to degrade than odd numbered chains on the other hand certain archaea the methanogens produce large quantites of methane by the metabolism of carbon dioxide or other oxidised organic compounds the energy is released by the oxidation of hydrogen co two four h two ch four two h two o methanogens are also the producers of marsh gas in wetlands and release about two billion tonnes of methane per year the atmospheric content of this gas is produced nearly exclusively by them the methane output of cattle and other herbivores which can release up to one five zero litres per day and of termites is also due to methanogens they also produce this simplest of all alkanes in the intestines of humans methanogenic archaea are hence at the end of the carbon cycle with carbon being released back into the atmosphere after having been fixed by photosynthesis it is probable that our current deposits of natural gas were formed in a similar way fungi and plants water forms droplets on a thin film of alkane wax on the skin of the apple alkanes also play a role if a minor role in the biology of the three eukaryotic groups of organisms fungi plants and animals some specialised yeasts e g candida tropicale pichia sp rhodotorula sp can use alkanes as a source of carbon and or energy the fungus amorphotheca resinae prefers the longer chain alkanes in aviation fuel and can cause serious problems for aircraft in tropical regions in plants it is the solid long chain alkanes that are found they form a firm layer of wax the cuticle over areas of the plant exposed to the air this protects the plant against water loss while preventing the leaching of important minerals by the rain it is also a protection against bacteria fungi and harmful insects the latter sink with their legs into the soft waxlike substance and have difficulty moving the shining layer on fruits such as apples consists of long chain alkanes the carbon chains are usually between twenty and thirty carbon atoms in length and are made by the plants from fatty acids the exact composition of the layer of wax is not only species dependent but changes also with the season and such environmental factors as lighting conditions temperature or humidity animals alkanes are found in animal products although they are less important than unsaturated hydrocarbons on example is the shark liver oil which is approximately one four pristane two six one zero one four tetramethylpentadecane c one nine h four zero their occurrence is more important in pheromones chemical messenger materials on which above all insects are dependent for communication with some kinds as the support beetle xylotrechus colonus primarily pentacosane c two

pest control ecological relations early spider orchid ophrys sphegodes one example in which both plant and animal alkanes play a role is the ecological relationship between the sand bee andrena nigroaenea and the early spider orchid ophrys sphegodes the latter is dependent for pollination on the former sand bees use pheromones in order to identify a mate in the case of a nigroaenea the females emit a mixture of tricosane c two three h four eight pentacosane c two five h five two and heptacosane c two seven h five six in the ratio three three one and males are attracted by specifically this odour the orchid takes advantage of this mating arrangement to get the male bee to collect and disseminate its pollen parts of its flower not only resemble the appearance of sand bees but also produce large quantities of the three alkanes in the same ratio as female sand bees as a result numerous males are lured to the blooms and attempte to copulate with their imaginary partner although this endeavour is not crowned with success for the bee it allows the orchid to transfer its pollen which will be dispersed after the departure of the frustrated male to different blooms see also cycloalkane higher alkanes alkene alkyne functional group cracking chemistry list of alkanes hydrocarbons alkanes this article is about the legal term for other usages see appeal disambiguation an appeal is the act or fact of challenging a judicially cognizable and binding judgment to a higher judicial authority in common law jurisdictions most commonly this means formally filing a notice of appeal with a lower court indicating one s intention to take the matter to the next higher court with jurisdiction over the matter and then actually filing the appeal with the appropriate appellate court united states the united states legal system generally recognizes two types of appeals a trial de novo or an appeal on the record a trial de novo is usually available for review of informal proceedings conducted by administrative agency referees masters commissioners and some minor judicial tribunals in proceedings that do not provide all the procedural attributes of a formal judicial trial if unchallenged these decisions have the power to settle more minor legal disputes once and for all if a party is dissatisfied with the finding of such a tribunal one generally has the power to request a trial de novo by a court of record in such a proceeding all issues and evidence may be developed newly as though never heard before and one is not restricted to the evidence heard in the lower proceeding sometimes however the decision of the lower proceeding is itself admissible as evidence thus helping to curb frivolous appeals in an appeal on the record from a decision in a judicial proceeding both appellant and respondent are bound to base their arguments wholly on the proceedings and body of evidence as they were presented in the lower tribunal each seeks to prove to the higher court that the result they desired was the just result precedent and case law figure prominently in the arguments in order for the appeal to succeed the appellant must prove that the lower court committed reversible error that is an impermissible action by the court acted to cause a result that was unjust and which would not have resulted had the court acted properly some examples of reversible error would be erroneously instructing the jury on the law applicable to the case permitting seriously improper argument by an attorney admitting or excluding evidence improperly acting outside the court s jurisdiction injecting bias into the proceeding or appearing to do so juror misconduct etc the failure to formally object at the time to what one views as improper action in the lower court may result in the affirmance of the lower court s judgment on the grounds that one did not preserve the issue for appeal by objecting in cases where a judge rather than a jury decided issues of fact an appellate court will apply an abuse of discretion standard of review under this standard the appellate court gives deference to the lower court s view of the evidence and reverses its decision only if it was a clear abuse of discretion this is usually defined as a decision outside the bounds of reasonableness on the other hand the appellate court normally gives less deference to a lower court s decision on issues of law and may reverse if it finds that the lower court applied the wrong legal standard in some rare cases an appellant may successfully argue that the law under which the lower decision was rendered was unconstitutional or otherwise invalid or may convince the higher court to order a new trial on the basis that evidence earlier sought was concealed or only recently discovered in the case of new evidence there must be a high probability that its presence or absence would have made a material difference in the trial another issue suitable for appeal in criminal cases is effective assistance of counsel if a defendant has been convicted and can prove that his lawyer did not adequately handle his case and that there is a reasonable probability that the result of the trial would have been different had the lawyer given competent representation he is entitled to a new trial an appellate court is a court that hears cases in which a lower court either a trial court or a lower level appellate court has already made a decision but in which at least one party to the action wants to challenge this ruling based upon some legal grounds that are allowed to be appealed either by right or by leave of the appellate court these grounds typically include errors of law fact or due process in different jurisdictions appellate courts are also called appeals courts courts of appeals superior courts or supreme courts who can appeal a party who files an appeal is called an appellant and a party on the other side is an appellee or respondent or in some jurisdictions the party who files is known as a petitioner and the party being sued is designated the respondent cross appeals can also occur when more than one party to a case is unhappy with the decision in some way often when the winning party claims that more damages were deserved than were awarded an appeal as of right is one that is guaranteed by statute or some underlying constitutional or legal principle the appellate court cannot refuse to listen to the appeal an appeal by leave or permission requires the appellant to move for leave to appeal in such a situation either or both of the lower court and the appellate court have the discretion to grant or refuse the appellant s demand to appeal the lower court s decision in tort equity or other civil matters either party to a previous case may file an appeal in criminal matters however the state or prosecution generally has no appeal as of right and due to the double jeopardy principle the state or prosecution may never appeal a jury or bench verdict but in some jurisdictions the state or prosecution may appeal as of right from a trial court s dismissal of an indictment in whole or in part or from a trial court s granting of a defendant s suppression motion likewise in some jurisdictions the state or prosecution may appeal an issue of law by leave from the trial court and or the appellate court how an appeal is processed generally speaking the appellate court examines the record of evidence presented in the trial court and the law that the lower court applied and decides whether that decision was legally sound or not the appellate court will typically be deferential to the lower court s findings of fact such as whether a defendant committed a particular act unless clearly erroneous and so will focus on the court s application of the law to those facts such as whether the act found by the court to have occurred fits a legal definition at issue if the appellate court finds no defect it affirms the judgment if the appellate court does find a legal defect in the decision below i e in the lower court it may modify the ruling to correct the defect or it may nullify reverse or vacate the whole decision or any part of it it may in addition send the case back remand or remit to the lower court for further proceedings to remedy the defect in some cases an appellate court may review a lower court decision de novo or completely challenging even the lower court s findings of fact this might be the proper standard of review for example if the lower court resolved the case by granting a pre trial motion to dismiss or motion for summary judgment which is usually based only upon written submissions to the trial court and not on any trial testimony another situation is where appeal is by way of re hearing certain jurisdictions permit certain appeals to cause the trial to be heard afresh in the appellate court an example would be an appeal from a magistrate s court to the crown court in england and wales sometimes the appellate court finds a defect in the procedure the parties used in filing the appeal and dismisses the appeal without considering its merits which has the same effect as affirming the judgment below this would happen for example if the appellant waited too long under the appellate court s rules to file the appeal in england and many other jurisdictions however the phrase appeal dismissed is equivalent to the u s term affirmed and the phrase appeal allowed is equivalent to the u s term reversed generally there is no trial in an appellate court only consideration of the record of the evidence presented to the trial court and all the pre trial and trial court proceedings are reviewed unless the appeal is by way of re hearing new evidence will usually only be considered on appeal in very rare instances for example if that material evidence was unavailable to a party for some very significant reason such as prosecutorial misconduct in some systems an appellate court will only consider the written decision of the lower court together with any written evidence that was before that court and is relevant to the appeal in other systems the appellate court will normally consider the record of the lower court in those cases the record will first be certified by the lower court the appellant has the opportunity to present arguments for the granting of the appeal and the appellee or respondent can present arguments against it arguments of the parties to the appeal are presented through their appellate lawyers if represented or pro se if the party has not engaged legal representation those arguments are presented in written briefs and sometimes in oral argument to the court at a hearing at such hearings each party is allowed a brief presentation at which the appellate judges ask questions based on their review of the record below and the submitted briefs it is important to note that in an adversarial system appellate courts do not have the power to review lower court decisions unless a party appeals it therefore if a lower court has ruled in an improper manner or against legal precedent that judgment will stand even if it might have been overturned on appeal in the united states a lawyer traditionally starts an oral argument to any appellate court with the words may it please the court see also list of legal topics

defence a reply to a question or objection or a correct solution of a problem in the common law an answer is the first pleading by a defendant usually filed and served upon the plaintiff within a certain strict time limit after a civil complaint or criminal information or indictment has been served upon the defendant it may have been preceded by an optional pre answer motion to dismiss or demurrer if such a motion is unsuccessful the defendant must file an answer to the complaint or risk an adverse default judgment the answer establishes which allegations cause of action in civil matters set forth by the complaining party will be contested by the defendant and states all the defendant s defenses thus establishing the nature and parameters of the controversy to be decided by the court in the case of a criminal case there is usually an arraignment or some other kind of appearance before the court by the defendant the pleading in the criminal case which is entered on the record in open court is either guilty or not guilty generally speaking in private civil cases there is no guilt or innocence there is only a judgment that grants money damages or some other kind of

guilty and the peremptory pleas or pleas in bar which set out reasons why a trial cannot proceed in addition us jurisdictions allow pleas of nolo contendere no contest and the alford plea in some circumstances in the uk arraignment is the first of eleven stages in a criminal trial and involves the clerk of the court reading out the indictment the defendant is asked whether they plead guilty or not guilty to each individual charge guilty and not guilty pleas if the defendant pleads guilty an evidentiary hearing usually follows the court is not required to accept a guilty plea during that hearing the judge will assess the offense mitigating factors and the defendant s character and then pass sentence if the defendant pleads not guilty a date will be set for a preliminary hearing or trial what if the defendant enters no plea in the past a defendant who refused to plea or stood mute would be subjected to peine forte et dure law french for strong and hard punishment but today in

often found in christian hymnals in a wide variety of churches in the united states and may be sung as part of a christian service of worship to god history the words are by katharine lee bates an english teacher at wellesley college she had taken a train trip to colorado springs colorado in one eight nine three to teach a short summer school session at colorado college and several of the sights on her trip found their way into her poem the world s columbian exposition in chicago illinois the white city with its promise of the future contained within its alabaster buildings the wheat fields of kansas through which her train was riding on july four the majestic view of the great plains from atop pike s peak on that mountain the words of the poem started to come to her and she wrote them down upon returning to her hotel room at the original antlers hotel the poem was initially published two years later in the congregationalist to commemorate the fourth of july it quickly caught the public s fancy amended versions were published in one nine zero four and one nine one three several existing pieces of music were adapted to the poem the hymn materna composed in one eight eight two by samuel a ward was generally considered the best music as early as one nine one zero and is still the popular tune today ward had been similarly inspired the tune came to him while he was on a ferryboat trip from coney island back to his home in new york city after a leisurely summer day and he immediately wrote it down ward died in one nine zero three not knowing the national stature his music would attain miss bates was more fortunate as the song s popularity was well established by her death in one nine two nine at various times in the more than one zero zero years that have elapsed since the song as we know it was born particularly during the john f kennedy administration there have been efforts to give america the beautiful legal status either as a national hymn or as a national anthem equal to or in place of the star spangled banner but so far this has not succeeded proponents prefer america the beautiful for various reasons saying it is easier to sing more melodic and more adaptable to new orchestrations while still remaining as easily recognizable as the star spangled banner some prefer america the beautiful over the star spangled banner due to the latter s war oriented imagery others prefer the star spangled banner for the same reason while that national dichotomy has stymied any effort at changing the tradition of the national anthem america the beautiful continues to be held in high esteem by a large number of americans popularity of the song soared following the september one one two zero zero one attacks at some sporting events it was sung in addition to the traditional singing of the national anthem ray charles is credited with the song s most well known rendition in current times although elvis presley had a good success with it in the seven zero s his recording is very commonly played at major sporting events such as the super bowl his unique take on it places the third verse first after which he sings the usual first verse in the third verse see below the author scolds the materialistic and self serving robber barons of her day and urges america to live up to its noble ideals and to honor with both word and deed the memory of those who died for their country a message that resonates just as strongly today an amusing oddity of the song is that its meter technically common meter double or eight six eight six eight six

and familiar as america the beautiful inevitably gets used out of its proper context or time frame for humorous effect as the song seems to have always been there it is often presented as if christopher columbus had written it when he arrived at the new world though in fact columbus never set foot on north america all his voyages were to the caribbean islands south and central america

by enabling them to perform tasks that they were formerly unable to accomplish or had great difficulty accomplishing by providing enhancements to or changed methods of interacting with the technology needed to accomplish such tasks according to disability advocates technology all too often is created without regard to people with disabilities and unnecessary barriers make new technology inaccessible to hundreds of millions universal or broadened accessibility or universal design means excellent usability particularly for people with disabilities but argue advocates of assistive technology universally accessible technology yields great rewards to the typical user good accessible design is universal design they say the classic example of an assistive technology that has improved everyone s life is the curb cuts in the sidewalk at street crossings while these curb cuts surely enable pedestrians with mobility impairments to cross the street they have also aided parents with carriages and strollers shoppers with carts and travellers and workers with pull type bags not to mention skateboarders and inline skaters consider an example of an assistive technology the modern telephone is except for the deaf universally accessible combined with a text telephone also known as a tdd telephone device for the deaf and in the usa generally called a ttyteletypewriter which converts typed characters into tones that may be sent over the telephone line the deaf person is able to communicate immediately at a distance together with relay services where an operator reads what the deaf person types and types what a hearing person says the deaf person is then given access to everyone s telephone not just those of people who possess text telephones many telephones now have volume controls which are primarily intended for the benefit of people who are hard of hearing but can be useful for all users at times and places where there is significant background noise another example calculators are cheap but a person with a mobility impairment can have difficulty using them speech recognition software could recognize short commands and make use of calculators a little easier people with cognitive disabilities would appreciate the simplicity others would as well toys which have been adapted to be used by children with disabilities may have advantages for typical children as well the lekotek movement assists parents by lending assistive technology toys and expertise to families telecare is a particular sort of assistive technology that uses electronic sensors connected to an alarm system to help caregivers manage risk and help vulnerable people stay independent at home longer a good example would be the systems being put in place for senior people such as fall detectors thermometers for hypothermia risk flooding and unlit gas sensors for people with mild dementia the principle being that these alerts can be customised to the particular person s risks when the alert is triggered a message is sent to a carer or contact centre who can respond appropriately the range of sensors is wide and expanding rapidly technology similar to telecare can also be used to act within a person s home rather than just to respond to a detected crisis using one of the examples above unlit gas sensors for people with dementia can be used to trigger a device that turns off the gas and tells someone what has happened this is safer than just telling an external person that there is a problem designing for people with dementia is a good example of where the design of the interface of a piece of assistive technology at is critical to its usefulness it is important to make sure that people with dementia or any other identified user group are involved in the design process to make sure that the design is accessible and useable in the example above a voice message could be used to remind the person with dementia to turn of the gas himself but who s voice should be used and what should the message say questions like these must be answered through user consultantion involvement and evaluation assistive technology products standing frames support

with beads sliding on wires it was in use centuries before the adoption of the written hindu arabic numeral system and is still widely used by merchants and clerks in china and elsewhere the origins of the abacus are disputed suggestions including invention in babylonia and in china to have taken place between two four zero zero bc and three zero zero bc the first abacus was almost certainly based on a flat stone covered with sand or dust lines were drawn in the sand and pebbles used to aid calculations from this a variety of abaci were developed the most popular were based on the bi quinary system using a combination of two bases base two and base five to represent decimal numbers the use of the word abacus dates back to before one three eight seven when a middle english work borrowed the word from latin to describe a sandboard abacus the latin word came from abakos the greek genitive form of abax calculating table because abax also had the sense of table sprinkled with sand or dust used for drawing geometric figures it is speculated by some linguists that the greek word may be derived from a semitic root b q the hebrew word for dust though details of the transmission are obscure it may also be derived from the phoenician word abak meaning sand the plural of abacus is abaci babylonian abacus a tablet found on the island of salamis near greece in one eight four six dates back to the babylonians of three zero zero bc making it the oldest counting board discovered so far it was originally thought to be a gaming board its construction is a slab of white marble measuring one four nine cm in length seven five cm in width and four five cm thick on which are five groups of markings in the center of the tablet are a set of five parallel lines equally divided by a vertical line capped with a semi circle at the intersection of the bottom most horizontal line and the single vertical line below these lines is a wide space with a horizontal crack dividing it below this crack is another group of eleven parallel lines again divided into two sections by a line perpendicular to them but with the semi circle at the top of the intersection the third sixth and ninth of these lines are marked with a cross where they intersect with the vertical line roman abacus reconstruction of roman abacus the late empire roman abacus shown here in reconstruction contains eight long and eight shorter grooves the former having up to five beads in each and the latter one the groove marked i indicates units x tens and so on up to millions the beads in the shorter grooves denote fives five units five tens etc essentially in a bi quinary coded decimal system obviously related to the roman numerals the short grooves on the right may have been used for marking roman ounces computations are made by means of beads which would probably have been slid up and down the grooves to indicate the value of each column chinese abacus the suanpan of the chinese is similar to the roman abacus in principle though has a different construction and it was designed to do both decimal and hexadecimal arithmetics chinese abacus the suanpan the chinese abacus is typically around two zero cm eight inches tall and it comes in various widths depending on the application it usually has more than seven rods there are two beads on each rod in the upper deck and five beads each in the bottom for both decimal and hexadecimal computation the beads are usually rounded and made of a hard wood the beads are counted by moving them up or down towards the beam the abacus can be reset to the starting position instantly by a quick jerk along the horizontal axis to spin all the beads away from the horizontal beam at the center chinese abaci can be used for functions other than counting unlike the simple counting board used in elementary schools very efficient suanpan techniques have been developed to do multiplication division addition subtraction square root and cube root operations at high speed bead arithmetic is the calculating technique used with various types of abaci in particular the chinese abacus japanese abacus soroban the japanese eliminated first one bead from the upper deck and later another bead from the lower deck in each column of the chinese abacus the japanese also eliminated the use of qiuchu chinese division table the method of chinese division table was still used when there were five lower beads there came the war of the multiplication table versus the division table the school of multiplication table prevailed in one nine two zero s the rods number of digits increase to usually two one two three two seven or even three one thus allowing calculation for more digits soroban is taught in elementary schools as a part of lessons in mathematics when teaching the soroban a song like instruction is given by the tutor the soroban is about eight cm three inches tall the beads on a soroban are usually shaped as a double cone bi cone to facilitate ease of movement often primary students may bring along with them two sorobans one with one upper bead and five lower beads the other with one upper bead with four lower beads when they learn soroban in school the size of beads of soroban is standardized and they come in two types the japanese classified soroban for native japanese and a separate size for foreigners since westerners tend to be larger than most japanese and therefore have larger hands and fingers the soroban that are for foreigners are made with a plastic pipe on both the left and right side of the frame while ones made for native japanese were all made with wooden frames in this way the thickness of the soroban for foreigners is higher rendering it easier for the non japanese to manipulate japanese soroban russian abacus russian abacus the russian abacus the schoty or sjotty usually has a single slanted deck with ten beads on each wire except one wire which has four and acts as a separator or for fractions this wire is usually near the user the russian abacus is often used vertically with wires from left to right in the manner of a book the wires are usually bowed to bulge upward in the center in order to keep the beads pinned to either of the two sides it is cleared when all the beads are moved to the right during manipulation beads are moved to the left for easy viewing the middle two beads on each wire the five th and six th bead usually have a colour different to the other eight beads likewise the left bead of the thousands wire and the million wire if present may have a different color the russian abacus is still in common use today in shops and markets throughout the former soviet union although it is no longer taught in most schools school abacus school abacus used in danish elementary school early two zero th century around the world abaci have been used in pre schools and elementary schools as an aid in teaching arithmetics in western countries a bead frame similar to the russian abacus but with straight wires has been common see image it is still often seen as a plastic or wooden toy uses by the visually impaired abaci are still commonly used by individuals who have visual impairments they use an abacus to perform the mathematical functions multiplication division addition subtraction square root and cubic root a piece of soft fabric or rubber is placed behind the beads so that they don t move inadvertently this keeps the beads in place while the user feels or manipulates them recently abaci have been replaced to some extent by electronic calculators with speech but only in those countries where they are easily available and affordable however even when they are available many visually impaired people still prefer to use the abacus in addition many blind children are required to learn how to use the abacus before they are permitted the use of a talking calculator or similar device this can be compared to sighted children being required to learn how to solve mathematical problems on paper before they are allowed the use of a calculator native american abacus some sources mention the use of an abacus

mathematical tools mechanical calculators an acid often represented by the generic formula ha is a water soluble sour tasting chemical compound that when dissolved in water gives a solution with a ph of less than seven definitions of acids and bases the word acid comes from the latin acidus meaning sour but in chemistry the term acid has a more specific meaning there are three common ways to define an acid namely the arrhenius the br nsted lowry and the lewis definitions in order of increasing generality arrhenius according to this definition an acid is a substance that increases the concentration of hydronium ion h three o when dissolved in water while bases are substances that increase the concentration of hydroxide ions oh this definition limits acids and bases to substances that can dissolve in water around one eight zero zero many french chemists including antoine lavoisier incorrectly believed that all acids contained oxygen english chemists including sir humphry davy at the same time believed all acids contained hydrogen the swedish chemist svante arrhenius used this belief to develop this definition of acid br nsted lowry according to this definition an acid is a proton donor and a base is a proton acceptor the acid is said to be dissociated after the proton is donated an acid and the corresponding base are referred to conjugate acid base pairs br nsted and lowry formulated this definition which includes water insoluble substances not in the arrhenius definition lewis according to this definition an acid as an electron pair acceptor and a base is an electron pair donor these are frequently referred to as lewis acids and lewis bases and are electrophiles and nucleophiles in organic chemistry lewis acids include substances with no protons such as iron iii chloride the lewis definition can also be explained with molecular orbital theory in general an acid can receive an electron pair in its lowest unoccupied orbital lumo from the highest occupied orbital homo of a base that is the homo from the base and the lumo from the acid combine to a bonding molecular orbital this definition was developed by gilbert n lewis although not the most general theory the br nsted lowry definition is the most widely used definition the strength of an acid may be understood by this defintion by the stability of hydronium and the solvated conjugate base upon dissociation increasing stability of the the conjugate base will increase the acidity of a compound this concept of acidity is used frequently for organic acids such as carboxylic acid the molecular orbital description where the unfilled proton orbital overlaps with a lone pair is connected to the lewis definition solutions of weak acids and salts of their conjugate bases form buffer solutions acid base systems are different from redox reactions in that there is no change in oxidation state generally acids have the following chemical and physical properties taste acids generally are sour when dissolved in water touch acids produce a stinging feeling particularly strong acids reactivity acids react aggressively with or corrode most metals electrical conductivity acids are electrolytes strong acids are dangerous causing severe burns for even minor contact generally acid burns are treated by rinsing the affected area abundantly with water and followed up with immediate medical attention nomenclature acids are named according to the ending of their anion that ionic ending is dropped and replaced with a new suffix according to the table below for example hcl has chloride as its anion so the ide suffix makes it take the form hydrochloric acid chemical characteristics in water the following equilibrium occurs between an acid ha and water which acts as a base ha aq h three o aq a aq the acidity constant or acid dissociation constant is the equilibrium constant for the reaction of ha with water k a three mbox cdota over ha strong acids have large k a values i e the reaction equilibrium lies far to the right the acid is almost completely dissociated to h three o and a strong acids include the heavier hydrohalic acids hydrochloric acid hcl hydrobromic acid hbr and hydroiodic acid hi however hydrofluoric acid hf is relatively weak for example the k a value for hydrochloric acid hcl is one zero seven weak acids have small k a values i e at equilibrium significant amounts of ha and a exist together in solution modest levels of h three o are present the acid is only partially dissociated for example the ka value for acetic acid is one eight x one zero five most organic acids are weak acids oxoacids which tend to contain central atoms in high oxidation states surrounded by oxygen may be quite strong or weak nitric acid sulfuric acid and perchloric acid are all strong acids whereas nitrous acid sulfurous acid and hypochlorous acid are all weak note the following the terms hydrogen ion and proton are used interchangebly both refer to h in aqueous solution the water is protonated to form hydronium ion h three o aq this is often abbreviated as h aq even though the symbol is not chemically correct the strength of an acid is measured by its acid dissociation constant k a or equivalently its p k a p k a log k a the ph of a solution is a measurement of the concentration of hydronium this will depend of the concnetration and nature of acids and bases in solution polyprotic acids polyprotic acids are able to donate more than one proton per acid molecule in contrast to monoprotic acids that only donate one proton per molecule specific types of polyprotic acids have more specific names such as diprotic acid two potenital protons to donate and triprotic acid three potenital protons to donate a monoprotic acid can undergo one dissociation sometimes called ionization as follows and simply has one acid dissociation constant as shown above ha aq h two o l h three o aq a aq k a a diprotic acid here symbolized by h two a can undergo one or two dissociations depending on the ph each dissociation has its own dissociation constant ka one and ka two h two a aq h two o l h three o aq ha aq k a one ha aq h two o l h three o aq a two aq k a two the first dissociation constant is typically greater than the second i e k a one k a two for example sulfuric acid h two so four can donate one proton to form the bisulfate anion hso four for which k a one is very large then it can donate a second proton to form the sulfate anion so four two wherein the k a two is intermediate strength the large k a one for the first dissociation makes sulfuric a strong acid in a similar manner the weak unstable carbonic acid h two co three can lose one proton to form bicarbonate anion hco three and lose a second to form carbonate anion co three two both k a values are small but k a one k a two a triprotic acid h three a can undergo one two or three dissociations and has three dissociation constants where k a one k a two k a three h three a aq h two o l h three o aq h two a aq k a one h two a aq h two o l h three o aq ha two aq k a two ha two aq h two o l h three o aq a three aq k a three an inorganic example of a triprotic acid is orthophosphoric acid h three po four usually just called phosphoric acid all three protons can be successively lost to yield h two po four then hpo four two and finally po four three the orthophosphate ion usually just called phosphate an organic example of a triprotic acid is citric acid which can successively lose three protons to finally form the citrate ion even though the positions of the protons on the original molecule may be equivalent the successive k a values will differ since it is energetically less favorable to lose a proton if the conjugate base is more negatively charged neutralization neutralization is the reaction between equal amounts of an acid and a base producing a salt and water for example hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide form sodium chloride and water hcl aq naoh aq h two o l nacl aq neutralization is the basis of titration where a ph indicator shows equivalence point when the equivalent number of moles of a base have been added

substances acids arabic words the term asphalt is often used as an abbreviation for asphalt concrete asphalt is a sticky black and highly viscous liquid or semi solid that is present in most crude petroleums and in some natural deposits asphalt is composed almost entirely of bitumen there is some disagreement amongst chemists regarding the structure of asphalt however it is most commonly modeled as a colloid with asphaltenes as the dispersed phase and maltenes as the continuous phase asphalt is sometimes confused with tar which is an artificial material produced by the destructive distillation of organic matter tar is also predominantly composed of bitumen however the bitumen content of tar is typically lower than that of asphalt tar and asphalt have very different engineering properties asphalt can be separated from the other components in crude oil such as naphtha gasoline and diesel by the process of fractional distillation usually under vacuum conditions a better separation can be achieved by further processing of the heavier fractions of the crude oil in a de asphalting unit which uses either propane or butane in a supercritical phase to dissolve the lighter molecules which are then separated further processing is possible by blowing the product namely reacting it with oxygen this makes the product harder and more viscous natural deposits of asphalt include lake asphalts primarily from the pitch lake in trinidad and tobago and bermudez lake in venezuela gilsonite the dead sea in israel and tar sands asphalt is rather hard to transport in bulk it hardens unless kept very hot so it is sometimes mixed with diesel oil or kerosene before shipping upon delivery these lighter materials are separated out of the mixture this mixture is often called bitumen feedstock or bfs the largest use of asphalt is for making asphalt concrete for pavements which accounts for approximately eight zero of the asphalt consumed in the united states roofing shingles account for most of the remaining asphalt consumption other uses include cattle sprays fence post treatments and waterproofing for fabrics in the ancient middle east natural asphalt deposits

many of the qualities to be found among alaskans generally independence friendliness practical mindedness and a love of the outdoors there is even among businesspeople in anchorage a tendency to dress down there is no dress code in any anchorage restaurant this and a sort of frontier spirit that still lives on in alaska generally gives anchorage a relatively casual relaxed atmosphere compared to some other american cities these cultural characteristics are only more exaggerated the farther one moves out of the city into the rest of alaska the city has traditionally served as a destination for immigrants and there are active asian eastern european and hispanic populations along with communities of african americans and various groups of aboriginal alaskans over nine five languages are

and the first manned mission to land on the moon it launched on july one six one nine six nine on july two zero mission commander neil armstrong and pilot edwin buzz aldrin became the first humans to set foot on the moon crew neil armstrong flew in gemini eight running long eagle was four seconds further along its descent trajectory than planned and would land miles west of the intended site the lm navigation and guidance computer reported several unusual program alarms as it guided the lm s descent these alarms tore the crew s attention away from the scene outside as the descent proceeded in nasa s mission control center in houston texas a young controller named steve bales told the flight director that it was safe to continue the descent in spite of the alarms once they returned their attention to the view outside the astronauts saw that their computer was guiding them toward a landing site full of large rocks scattered around a large crater armstrong took manual control of the lunar module at that point and guided it to a landing at two zero one seven utc on july two zero with about three zero seconds worth of fuel left the saturn v carrying apollo one one took several seconds to clear the tower on july one six one nine six nine the program alarms were executive overflows indicating that the computer could not finish its work in the time allotted the cause was later determined to be the lm rendezvous radar being left on during the descent causing the computer to spend unplanned time servicing the unused radar steve bales received a medal of freedom for his go call under pressure although apollo one one landed with less fuel than other missions they also encountered a premature low fuel warning it was later found caused by the lunar gravity permitting greater propellant slosh uncovering a fuel sensor extra baffles in the tanks were subsequently added at two five six utc on july two one six and a half hours after landing armstrong made his descent to the moon surface and took his famous one giant leap for mankind aldrin joined him and the two spent two and a half hours drilling core samples photographing what they saw and collecting rocks they planned placement of the early apollo scientific experiment package easep and the u s flag by studying their landing site through eagle s twin triangular windows which gave them a six zero field of view preparation required longer than the two hours scheduled armstrong had some initial difficulties squeezing through the hatch with his plss according to veteran moonwalker john young a redesign of the lm to incorporate a smaller hatch was not followed by a redesign of the plss backpack so some of the highest heart rates recorded from apollo astronauts occurred during lm egress and ingress buzz aldrin poses on the moon allowing neil armstrong to photograph both of them using the visor s reflection the remote control unit controls on armstrong s chest prevented him from seeing his feet while climbing down the nine rung ladder armstrong pulled a d ring to deploy the modular equipment stowage assembly mesa folded against eagle s side and activate the tv camera the first images used a slow scan television system and were picked up at goldstone in the usa but with better fidelity by honeysuckle creek in australia minutes later the tv was switched to normal television and the feed was switched to the more sensitive radio telescope station at the parkes observatory in australia despite some technical and weather difficulties ghostly black and white images of the first lunar eva were received and were immediately broadcast to at least six zero zero million people on earth after describing the surface very fine grained almost like a powder armstrong stepped off eagle s footpad and into history as the first human to set foot on another world he reported that moving in the moon s gravity one sixth of earth s was perhaps even easier than the simulations in addition to fulfilling president john f kennedy s mandate to land a man on the moon before the end of the one nine six zero s apollo one one was an engineering test of the apollo system therefore armstrong snapped photos of the lm so engineers would be able to judge its post landing condition he then collected a contingency soil sample using a sample bag on a stick he folded the bag and tucked it into a pocket on his right thigh he removed the tv camera from the mesa made a panoramic sweep and mounted it on a tripod one two m four zero ft from the lm the tv camera cable remained partly coiled and presented a tripping hazard throughout the eva photo of the actual plaque left on the moon attached to the ladder of the lm descent stage aldrin joined him on the surface and tested methods for moving around including two footed kangaroo hops the plss backpack created a tendency to tip backwards but neither astronaut had serious problems maintaining balance loping became the preferred method of movement the astronauts reported that they needed to plan their movements six or seven steps ahead the fine soil was quite slippery aldrin remarked that moving from sunlight into eagle s shadow produced no temperature change inside the suit though the helmet was warmer in sunlight so he felt cooler in shadow a visible shockwave formed as the saturn v encountered maximum dynamic pressure max q at about one minute two zero seconds into the flight altitude one two five km four km downrange velocity four four zero m s together the astronauts planted the u s flag then took a phone call from president richard nixon the mesa failed to provide a stable work platform and was in shadow slowing work somewhat as they worked the moonwalkers kicked up gray dust which soiled the outer part of their suits the integrated thermal meteoroid garment they deployed the easep which included a passive seismograph and a laser ranging retroreflector then armstrong loped about one two zero m four zero zero ft from the lm to snap photos at the rim of east crater while aldrin collected two core tubes he used the geological hammer to pound in the tubes the only time the hammer was used on apollo one one the astronauts then collected rock samples using scoops and tongs on extension handles many of the surface activities took longer than expected so they had to stop documented sample collection halfway through the allotted three four min neil armstrong works at the lm in one of the few photos taken of him from the lunar surface nasa photo as one one four zero five eight eight six during this period mission control used a coded phrase to warn armstrong that his metabolic rates were high and that he should slow down he was moving rapidly from task to task as time ran out rates remained generally lower than expected for both astronauts throughout the walk however so mission control granted the astronauts a one five minute extension lunar ascent and return aldrin entered eagle first with some difficulty the astronauts lifted film and two sample boxes containing more than two two kg four eight lb of lunar surface material to the lm hatch using a flat cable pulley device called the lunar equipment conveyor armstrong then jumped to the ladder s third rung and climbed into the lm after transferring to lm life support the explorers lightened the ascent stage for return to lunar orbit by tossing out their plss backpacks lunar overshoes one hasselblad camera and other equipment then they lifted off in eagle s ascent stage to rejoin cmp michael collins aboard columbia in lunar orbit eagle was jettisoned and left in lunar orbit later nasa reports mentioned that eagle s orbit had decayed resulting in it impacting in an uncertain location on the lunar surface after more than two hours on the lunar surface they returned to collins on board columbia bringing two zero eight seven kilograms of lunar samples with them the two moon walkers had left behind scientific instruments such as a retroreflector array used for the lunar laser ranging experiment they also left an american flag and other mementos including a plaque mounted on the lm descent stage ladder bearing two drawings of earth of the western and eastern hemispheres an inscription and signatures of the astronauts and richard nixon the inscription read here men from planet earthfirst set foot upon the

event the apollo one one astronauts were stranded on the moon fate has ordained that the men who went to the moon to explore in peace will stay on the moon to rest in peace these brave men neil armstrong and edwin aldrin know that there is no hope for their recovery but they also know that there is hope for mankind in their sacrifice these two men are laying down their lives in mankind s most noble goal the search for truth and understanding they will be mourned by their families and friends they will be mourned by their nation they will be mourned by the people of the world they will be mourned by a mother earth that dared send two of her sons into the unknown in their exploration they stirred the people of the world to feel as one in their sacrifice they bind more tightly the brotherhood of man in ancient days men looked at stars and saw their heroes in the constellations in modern times we do much the same but our heroes are epic men of flesh and blood others will follow and surely find their way home man s search will not be denied but these men were the first and they will remain the foremost in our hearts armstrong on lunar surface with gold visor raised from one

assembly of east crater communications link early in the planning of the project apollo nasa decided to combine all communications between spacecraft and earth into a single multiplexed feed called the unified s band system including audio communications television images crew medical telemetry and the spacecraft systems telemetry the signal was picked up by three purpose built stations goldstone california honeysuckle creek australia and fresnedillas spain and backed up by deep space network stations known as wing stations in australia spain and the united states at first the signal was routed to greenbelt maryland by way of submarine telephone cables using twelve voice circuits the signal was divided into twelve parts using inverse multiplexing sent onto the circuits and reintegrated in maryland before being sent on to nasa in houston intelsat satellites began taking over the trans oceanic transmissions toward the end of the one nine six zero s and nasa ended its contracts for the submarine telephone circuits which were then reallocated by telephone administrations for normal voice use on one four july one nine six nine the intelsat satellite over the atlantic failed a replacement was launched on one six july but went into a useless orbit and would not be reoriented in time to be used the early bird satellite was activated but thought it might not have enough power to get a signal to the united states the australia station was vital to picking up the signal during the moonwalks or keeping the astronauts waiting on the moon eight hours before venturing out a communications team was dispatched to spain to begin setting up the telephone circuits for nasa s inverse multiplexed signal european telecommunications administrators mostly government post offices were not accustomed to doing the business required they would normally require telegram messages to be exchanged with top level administrative approval but the twelve circuits had to be recovered from six countries to be made available to nasa which had set a time limit two hours before launch or the launch would be canceled it would be the last ideal launch window before one nine seven zero other launch windows had been missed due to spacecraft equipment problems an official with the spanish communications authority helped the team secure the circuits with his own personal list of contacts the last circuit using inverse multiplexing was accepted by nasa just minutes before the time limit three days later the transmissions from the moon were picked up in spain relayed to the united states over the undersea circuits and made available by nasa to the americas they were beamed across the pacific ocean and from the far east were carried on the indian ocean satellite the postal telephone authority in west germany turned a large radio dish to aim at the indian ocean satellite picking up the signal from australia and providing it to western europe therefore viewers in western europe saw neil armstrong set foot on the moon a full half second later than those in the united states and some one eight seconds after it actually happened had this vital communications link not been restored the pledge of president john f kennedy to land a man on the moon by the end of the decade would have been missed mission trivia and urban legends trivia some internal nasa planning documents referred to the callsigns of the csm and lm as snowcone and haystack these were quietly changed before being announced to the press shortly after landing before preparations have begun for the eva aldrin broadcast that this is the lm pilot i d like to take this opportunity to ask every person listening in whoever and wherever they may be to pause for a moment and contemplate the events of the past few hours and to give thanks in his or her own way he then took holy communion privately at this time nasa was still fighting a lawsuit brought by madalyn murray o hair who had objected to the apollo eight crew reading from the book of genesis which demanded that their astronauts refrain from religious activities while in space as such aldrin an episcopalian chose to refrain from directly mentioning this he had kept the plan quiet not even mentioning it to his wife and did not reveal it publicly for several years several books indicate that early mission timelines had buzz aldrin not neil armstrong as the first man on the moon a replica of the footprint left by neil armstrong is located in tranquility park in houston texas the park was dedicated in one nine seven nine a decade after the first moon landing the australian movie the dish two zero zero zero tells the slightly fictionalised story of how the images of the moon walk were received by the radio telescope at parkes observatory new south wales according to the hbo mini series from the earth to the moon michael collins made the following suggestion as to what armstrong should say upon stepping onto the lunar surface if you had any balls you d say oh my god what is that thing then scream and cut your mic armstrong claims to have said that s one small step for a man one giant leap for mankind although the a is not at all clear in recordings made at ground control it has been pointed out that the audio and video links were somewhat intermittent partly due to storms near parkes observatory recently digital analysis of the tape by nasa revealed the a may have been spoken but obscured by static folklore at some point while on the moon armstrong supposedly said good luck mr gorski some years later gorski died so he felt he could now explain this remark as a boy he heard a couple next door arguing and the wife said oral sex is it oral sex you want you ll get oral sex when the kid next door walks on the moon mr gorski this story is untrue neil armstrong apparently took a tartan where no tartan had been worn before a tiny swatch of the clan armstrong plaid was affixed to his suit when he walked on the moon another item that armstrong took with him was a special diamond studded astronaut pin which was given to deke slayton by the widows of the apollo one crew the pin had been intended to be flown in apollo one then given to deke after the mission but due to the disaster the widows ended up giving the pin to him after the funerals deke gave the pin to neil to leave at tranquility base two main conspiracy theories surround the mission firstly that the landing was a hoax this is generally discounted although it has slowly grown in popularity particularly since the release of the movie capricorn one one nine seven eight which portrays a nasa attempt to fake a landing on mars secondly a less well known urban legend suggests that they were being watched while on the moon and had seen alien vehicles there this grew in popularity after the book someone else is on our moon was published according to another legend a survey undertaken in the one nine eight zero s in morocco revealed that a substantial percentage didn t think man had landed on the moon this was not due to conspiracy theory but rather to that segment not having been informed see also extra

spaceflight sim references discussing mis quote lunar landing sites in honor of the first manned moon landing apollo program human spaceflights lunar spacecraft one nine six nine apollo eight was the second manned mission of the apollo space program in which commander frank borman command module pilot james lovell and lunar module pilot william anders became the first humans to leave earth orbit and to orbit around the moon it was also the first manned launch of the saturn v rocket nasa prepared for the mission in only four months the hardware involved had only been used a few times the saturn v had launched only twice before and the apollo spacecraft had only just finished its first manned mission apollo seven however the success of the mission paved the way for the successful completion of john f kennedy s goal of landing on the moon before the end of the decade after launching on december two one one nine six eight the crew took three days to travel to the moon which they orbited for two zero hours while in lunar orbit they made a christmas eve television broadcast this was one of the most watched broadcasts of all time planning on december two two one nine six six nasa announced the crew for the third manned apollo flight frank borman michael collins and bill anders collins was replaced by his backup jim lovell in july one nine six eight after collins had to have surgery as he was suffering cervical intervertebral disc herniation an intervertebral disc had slipped into the spinal cavity and required two vertebrae to be fused together collins recovered and went on to be the command module pilot for apollo one one in september one nine six seven the manned spacecraft center in houston texas proposed a series of missions that would lead up to a manned lunar landing seven mission types were outlined each testing a specific set of components and tasks each previous step needed to be completed successfully before the next mission type could be undertaken these were a unmanned command service module csm test b unmanned lunar module lm test c manned csm in low earth orbit d manned csm and lm in low earth orbit e manned csm and lm in an elliptical earth orbit with an apogee of four six zero zero mi seven four zero zero km f manned csm and lm in lunar orbit g manned lunar landing of all the components of the apollo system the lunar module lm which would eventually be used to land on the moon presented the most problems it was behind schedule and when the first model was shipped to cape canaveral in june one nine six eight over one zero one separate defects were discovered grumman aircraft engineering corporation which was the lead contractor for the lm predicted that the first mannable lm to be used for the d mission would not be ready until at least february one nine six nine delaying the entire sequence apollo csm diagram nasa george low the manager of the apollo spacecraft program office proposed a solution in august since the command service module csm would be ready three months before the lunar module they could fly a csm only mission in december one nine six eight but instead of just repeating the flight of apollo seven the c mission that would fly the csm in earth orbit they could send the csm all the way to the moon and maybe even enter into orbit this mission was dubbed the c prime mission this new mission would allow nasa to test procedures that would be used on the manned lunar landings that would otherwise have to wait until apollo one zero the f mission there were also concerns from the cia that the soviets were planning their own circumlunar flight for december to upstage the americans once again see zond program the first stage of as five zero three being erected in the vab on february one one nine six eight almost every senior manager at nasa agreed with this new mission the only person who needed some convincing was james e webb the nasa administrator however outvoted by the rest of the agency he gave his approval after leading the agency for eight years he would resign just four days before the launch of apollo seven the first manned apollo flight deke slayton the director of flight crew operations decided to swap the crews of the d and e missions james mcdivitt the original commander of the d mission has said he was never offered the circumlunar flight but would probably have turned it down as he wanted to fly the lunar module borman on the other hand jumped at the chance his original mission would just have been a repeat of the previous flight except in a higher orbit this swap also meant a swap of spacecraft borman s crew would now use csm one zero three while mcdivitt s crew would use csm one zero four in the end the e mission was canceled as most its objectives had been covered by the apollo eight and apollo nine flights mission managers were also confident that apollo one zero would also cover the remaining objectives with its lunar orbit flight on september nine the crew entered the simulators to begin their preparation for the flight by the time the mission flew the crew would have spent seven hours training for every actual hour of flight although all crew members were trained for all aspects of the mission it was necessary to specialize borman as commander was given training on controlling the spacecraft during the re entry lovell was trained on navigating the spacecraft in case communication was lost with the earth anders was placed in charge of checking the spacecraft was in working order it was not until november one two that a public announcement was made about the change of mission for apollo eight previous to this thomas o paine the deputy administrator of nasa had made a fleeting remark that all options were being considered borman s main concern during the four months leading up to the launch was keeping the flight plan as simple as possible not accepting any addition that went beyond the simple objectives of performing the first manned saturn v launch going to the moon and orbiting it he made sure that they stayed in lunar orbit only as long as necessary one zero orbits the crew now living in the crew quarters at kennedy space center received a visit from charles lindbergh the night before the launch they talked about how before his flight lindbergh had used a piece of string to measure the distance from new york to paris on a globe and from that calculated the fuel needed for the flight the total was a tenth of the amount that the saturn v would burn every second the saturn v the apollo eight saturn v being rolled out to pad three nine a the saturn v rocket used by apollo eight was designated sa five zero three the third flight model when it was erected in the vertical assembly building on two zero december one nine six seven it was thought that the rocket would be used for an unmanned test flight carrying a boilerplate command service module although apollo six had suffered several major problems it suffered severe pogo oscillation during its first stage and two second stage engines shutdown early marshall space flight center in charge of the saturn v was confident that it could solve all the issues without the need for another unmanned test flight the sa five zero three mission was thus changed to a manned one however nasa managers did impose some restrictions on a manned flight taking place the s ii second stage had to undergo cryogenic testing at the mississippi test facility and other changes were to be made to man rate the vehicle so on april three zero the saturn v was unstacked and the s ii second stage shipped by barge to the test site the spark igniters on the second and third stage engines were also modified in may one nine six eight a leak was found in a first stage engine requiring it to be replaced with only two launches of the saturn v under its belt the ground crew at kennedy space center ksc was having problems keeping to the schedule the grumman crew was also having issues with the lunar module concern was expressed at the fact so much work had to be done on the lunar module after it had shipped to the cape the ascent engine developed leaks that caused redesigns and valve changes then in august one nine six eight the entire mission changed sa five zero three would launch men to the moon and would not be carrying a lunar module instead carrying a mass equivalent called a lunar module test article lta similar to ones used for apollo four and apollo six in order to speed up the pre launch preparations much of the modification of the saturn v was taken out of the hands of ksc and given to appropriate development centers only changes that affected crew safety were made the apollo eight spacecraft was placed on top of the rocket on september two one and the rocket made the slow three mile five km journey to the launch pad on nine october testing continued all through december until the day before launch the sa five zero three designation stood for saturn apollo and was used by nasa departments concerned with the launch vehicle however departments concerned with the manned flight often used as five zero three standing for apollo saturn both of these designations were used at the time to refer to the mission as a whole the five zero three number indicated that it was flight number three five zero three of the saturn v five zero three the mission launch and trans lunar injection apollo eight launch the photo is a double exposure as the moon was not visible at the time of launch nasa apollo eight launched at seven five one zero zero a m eastern standard time on december two one one nine six eight the entire launch phase was practically flawless with only minor problems the s ic first stage s engines underperformed by zero seven five causing the engines to burn for two four five seconds longer than planned towards the end of the second stage burn the rocket underwent pogo oscillations that frank borman estimated were of the order of one two hz and about zero two five g two five m s the first manned saturn v placed the spacecraft into a one one two eight mi by one one eight nine mi one eight one five km by one nine one three km earth orbit with a period of eight eight minutes and one zero seconds the apogee was also slightly higher than intended with a planned circular orbit of one one five mi one eight five km the s ic impacted the atlantic ocean at and the s ii at for the next two hours and three eight minutes the crew and mission control worked to check that the spacecraft was in working in order and ready for trans lunar injection tli the burn that would put the spacecraft on a trajectory to the moon at the same time the crew transformed the capsule from a rocket payload to a spacecraft and the s ivb third stage had to be in working order on the previous unmanned test the s ivb had failed to re ignite during the flight there would be three capsule communicators usually referred to as capcoms on a rotating roster these were the only people who would normally communicate with the crew michael collins was the first of these on duty and at two hours two seven minutes and two two seconds after launch radioed apollo eight you are go for tli mission control had given official permission for the crew to go to the moon over the next twelve minutes before the burn the crew continued to monitor the spacecraft and the rocket the s ivb third stage rocket ignited on time and burned perfectly for five minutes and one seven seconds the burn increased the velocity of the spacecraft to three five five zero five ft s one zero eight two two m s and their altitude at the end of the burn was two one five four mi three four six seven km they were the fastest humans in history now that the s ivb had performed its required tasks it was jettisoned the crew then rotated the spacecraft to take some photographs of the spent stage as well as practiced flying in formation with it as the crew rotated the spacecraft around they had their first views of the earth as they moved away from it this was the first time humans had been able to see the entire earth in one go borman became worried that the s ivb was staying too close to the csm and suggested to mission control that the crew perform a separation maneuver mission control at first suggested pointing the spacecraft towards earth and using the reaction control system rcs thrusters on the service module to add three ft s zero nine m s away from the earth but borman did not want to lose sight of the s ivb after much discussion it was decided to burn in this direction anyway but at nine ft s two seven m s these discussions ended up putting the crew an hour behind their flight plan five hours after launch mission control commanded the s ivb booster to vent its remaining fuel through its engine bell to change its trajectory such that it would flyby the moon and enter into a solar orbit so as to pose no future hazard to the crew it went into a zero nine nine by zero nine two au solar orbit with an inclination of two three four seven and a period of three four zero eight zero days the members of the apollo eight crew were the first humans to pass through the van allen radiation belts which extend up to one five zero zero zero mi two five zero zero zero km from earth although it was predicted that the passage through the belts would cause a radiation dosage of no more than a chest x ray or one milligray during the course of a year the average human receives a dose of two to three mgy there was still interest in the radiation dosages on the crew so each crewmember wore a personal radiation dosimeter that could be read back to the ground as well as three passive film dosimeters that show the cumulative radiation experienced by the crew by the end of the mission the average radiation dose of the crew was one six mgy coasting to the moon one of the first images taken by humans of the whole earth probably photographed by bill anders south is up with south america in the middle jim lovell s main job as command module pilot was to act as navigator although mission control performed all the actual navigation calculation it was necessary that in case of communication loss the crew could navigate their way home this was done by star sightings using a sextant built into the spacecraft measuring the angle between a star and the earth s or the moon s horizon this proved to be difficult as the venting by the s ivb had caused a large cloud of debris to form around the spacecraft making it hard to distinguish what were the actual stars by seven hours into the mission the delay in moving away from the s ivb and lovell s star sightings meant that they were behind schedule on the flight plan by about one hour and four zero minutes the crew now placed the spacecraft into passive thermal control ptc or what is more aptly called barbecue mode this had the spacecraft roll about one rotation per hour along its long axis in order to ensure even heat distribution of the spacecraft in direct sunlight the spacecraft could be heated to over two zero zero c while the parts in shadow would be one zero zero c these temperatures could cause the heat shield to crack or propellant lines to burst as it was impossible to get a perfect roll the spacecraft actually swept out a cone as it rotated this would have to be trimmed every half hour as it started to get larger and larger the first mid course correction came one one hours into the flight testing on the ground had shown there was a small chance that the service propulsion system sps engine would explode when burned for long periods unless its combustion chamber was coated first this could be done by burning the engine for a short period this first correction burn was only two four seconds and added about two zero four ft s six two m s prograde in the direction of travel this was less than the two four eight ft s seven five m s planned and the shortfall was due to a bubble of helium in the oxidizer lines causing lower than expected fuel pressure requiring the crew to use the small reaction control system rcs thrusters to make up the shortfall two later planned midcourse corrections were cancelled as the trajectory was found to be perfect eleven hours into the flight the crew had been awake for over one six hours having been awakened about five hours before launch so it was time for frank borman to start his scheduled seven hour sleep period it proved difficult to sleep nasa had decided that at least one crewmember should be awake at all times to deal with any issues that might arise but the constant radio chatter with the ground and the air circulation fans made it hard to sleep as well as this sleeping in space is a somewhat unnatural experience you cannot rest your head on a pillow and bill anders said that he would suddenly jolt awake with the sensation that he was falling apollo eight s ivb rocket stage nasa about an hour after starting his sleep period borman requested clearance to take a seconal sleeping pill but the pill had little effect after borman slept for seven hours fitfully he awoke feeling ill he vomited twice and had a bout of diarrhea that left the spacecraft full of small globules of vomit and feces the crew cleaned up as best as they could borman decided that he did not want the world to know about his medical problems but lovell and anders still wanted to tell the ground they decided to use the data storage equipment dse which could be used by the crew to tape voice recordings and telemetry which were then dumped to the ground at high speed after recording a description of borman s illness they requested that mission control check the recording as the crew would like an evaluation of the voice comments a conference between the crew and medical personnel was held using the unoccupied second floor control room there were two identical control rooms in houston on the second and third floor of which only one is used during the course of a mission during a private communication with the crew it was decided that there was little to worry about and that it was either a two four hour flu as borman thought or just a reaction to the sleeping pill in fact it is now thought that he was suffering from space adaptation syndrome which affects about a third of astronauts during their first day in space as their vestibular system adapts to weightlessness it had never arisen on previous spacecraft mercury and gemini as they had been too small to move freely in in flight footage of the crew taken while they were in orbit around the moon in the center is frank borman the cruise phase was a relatively uneventful part of the flight with little happening except for the crew checking that the spacecraft was in working order and they were on course during this time nasa scheduled a television broadcast for three one hours after launch the camera used was two kg and broadcast in black and white only using a vidicon tube it had two lenses a very wide angle one six zero lens and a telephoto nine lens during this first broadcast the crew gave a tour of the spacecraft and attempted to show how the earth appeared however this proved impossible as the narrow angle lens was difficult to aim without the aid of a monitor to show what it was looking at also without proper filters the image became saturated by any bright source in the end all the crew could do was show the people watching back on earth a bright blob after broadcasting for one seven minutes the rotation of the spacecraft took the high gain antenna out of view of the receiving stations on earth and they ended the transmission with lovell wishing his mother happy birthday by this time the planned sleep periods had completely been abandoned three two hours into the flight lovell went to bed three hours before he had planned to a short while later anders also went to bed after taking a sleeping pill somewhat strangely the crew were unable to see the moon for much of the outward cruise three of the five windows had fogged up due to outgassed oils from the silicone sealant and due to the attitude required for the ptc the moon was almost impossible to see from inside the spacecraft in fact it was not until the crew had gone behind the moon that they would be able to see it for the first time a second television broadcast came at five five hours this time the crew had managed to rig up filters meant for the still cameras so that they could acquire images of the earth through the telephoto lens although difficult to aim as they had to maneuver the entire spacecraft the crew was able to broadcast back to earth the first television pictures of the earth the crew spent the transmission describing the earth and what was visible and the colors that could be seen the transmission lasted two three minutes lunar sphere of influence at about five five hours and four zero minutes into the flight the crew of apollo eight became the first humans to enter the gravitational sphere of influence of another celestial body or to put it another way the moon s gravitational force became stronger than that of the earth at the time it happened they were three eight seven five nine mi six two three seven seven km from the moon and had a speed of three nine nine zero ft s one two one six m s with respect to the moon this historic moment was of little interest to the crew as they still calculated their trajectory with respect to the launch pad at kennedy space center and would do so until they performed their last midcourse correction when they would switch to a reference frame based on ideal orientation for the second engine burn they would make in lunar orbit it was only thirteen hours until they would be in lunar orbit the last major event before lunar orbit insertion was a second midcourse correction it was in retrograde against direction of travel and slowed the spacecraft down by two zero ft s zero six m s in effect lowering the closest distance that the spacecraft would pass the moon at exactly six one hours after launch about two four two zero zero mi three nine zero zero zero km from the moon the crew burned the rcs for one one seconds they would now pass seven one seven mi one one five four km from the lunar surface at six four hours into the flight the crew began to prepare for lunar orbit insertion one loi one this maneuver had to be performed perfectly and due to orbital mechanics had to be on the far side of the moon out of contact with the earth after mission control was polled for a go no go decision the crew was told at six eight hours they were go and riding the best bird we can find at six eight hours and five eight minutes the spacecraft went behind the moon and out of radio contact with the earth with ten minutes before the loi one the crew began one last check of the spacecraft systems and made sure that every switch was in the correct place then they finally got their first glimpses of the moon they had been flying over the unlit side and it was lovell who saw the first shafts of sunlight obliquely illuminating the lunar surface but the burn was only two minutes away so the crew had little time to appreciate the view lunar orbit igniting at six nine hours eight minutes and one six seconds after launch the sps burned for four minutes and one three seconds placing the crew of apollo eight in orbit around the moon the crew described this as being the longest four minutes of their lives if the burn had not lasted exactly the right amount of time the spacecraft could have ended up in a highly elliptical lunar orbit or even flung off into space if it lasted too long they could have ended up impacting the moon after making sure the spacecraft was working they finally had a chance to look at the moon which they would orbit for the next two zero hours the first earthrise photographed by humans on earth mission control continued to wait if the crew had not burned the engine or the burn had not lasted the planned length of time the crew would appear early from behind the moon however this time came and went without apollo eight reappearing and then exactly at the predicted moment the signal was received from the spacecraft indicating it was in a one nine three three mi by six nine five mi three one one one km by one one one nine km orbit about the moon after reporting on the status of the spacecraft lovell gave the first description of what the lunar surface looked like the moon is essentially grey no color looks like plaster of paris or sort of a grayish beach sand we can see quite a bit of detail the sea of fertility doesn t stand out as well here as it does back on earth there s not as much contrast between that and the surrounding craters the craters are all rounded off there s quite a few of them some of them are newer many of them look like especially the round ones look like hit by meteorites or projectiles of some sort langrenus is quite a huge crater it s got a central cone to it the walls of the crater are terraced about six or seven different s on the way down lovell continued to describe the terrain that they were passing over one of the crew s major tasks was reconnaissance of the planned landing sites on the moon especially one in mare tranquillitatis that would be the apollo one one landing site the launch time of apollo eight had been chosen to give the best lighting conditions for the site a film camera had been set up in one of the windows to record a frame every second of the moon below and bill anders would spend much of the next two zero hours taking as many photographs as he could of targets of interest by the end of the mission the crew would take seven zero zero photographs of the moon and one five zero of the earth a portion of the lunar near side the large crater in the bottom half of the photo is goclenius throughout the hour that the spacecraft was in contact with the earth borman kept asking how the data for the sps looked he wanted to make sure that the engine was working and could be used to return early to the earth if necessary he also asked that they receive a go no go decision before they passed behind the moon on each orbit as they reappeared for their second pass in front of the moon the crew set up the television to broadcast a view of the lunar surface anders described the craters that they were passing over at the end of this second orbit they performed the eleven second loi two burn of the sps to circularize the orbit to seven zero zero mi by seven one three mi one one two six km by one one four eight km over the next two orbits the crew continued to keep check of the spacecraft and to observe and photograph the moon during the third pass borman read a small prayer for his church as he was meant to lay read during the midnight service at st christopher s episcopal church near seabrook texas but due to the apollo eight flight was unable a fellow parishioner and engineer at mission control rod rose suggested that borman read the prayer which could be recorded and then replayed during the service it was as the spacecraft came out from behind the moon for its fourth pass across the front that the crew witnessed an event never before seen earthrise anders glanced out the window and saw a blue and white orb and realized it was the earth instantly the crew understood that they needed to take a photograph of this anders took both the first photograph which was black and white and then later the more famous color photo after the flight borman and anders both claimed they took the first earthrise photo lovell also did but more as a joke than anything else it was determined that it was probably anders earth as seen from apollo eight december two four one nine six eight nasa anders continued to take photographs while lovell took the controls of the spacecraft so that borman could get some rest as always resting was difficult in the cramped and noisy capsule though borman was able to doze for two orbits he would awaken at times to ask a question about their status only to be told that everything was going fine borman did wake up however when he started to hear his fellow crewmembers make mistakes they were beginning to not understand questions and would have to ask for the answers to be repeated borman realized that everyone was extremely tired having not had a good night s sleep in over three days taking command he ordered anders and lovell to get some sleep and that the rest of the flight plan regarding observing the moon be scrubbed at first anders protested saying that he was fine but borman would not be swayed at last anders agreed as long as the commander would set up the camera to continue to take automatic shots of the moon borman also remembered that there was a second television broadcast planned and with so many people expected to be watching he wanted to crew to be alert for the next two orbits anders and lovell slept while borman sat at the helm as they rounded the moon for the ninth time the second television transmission began borman introduced the crew followed by each man giving his impression of the lunar surface and what it was like to be orbiting the moon borman described it as being a vast lonely forbidding type of existence or expanse of nothing and then after talking about what they were flying over anders said that the crew had a message for all those on earth the only thing left for the crew now was to perform the trans earth injection or tei which would occur two hours after the end of the television transmission this was the most critical burn of the whole flight if the sps failed to ignite then the crew would be stuck in orbit around the moon with only about five more days of oxygen and no chance of escape and once again the burn had to be performed while the crew was out of contact with earth on the far side of the moon the burn occurred perfectly on time the spacecraft telemetry was reacquired as it re emerged from behind the moon at eight nine hours two eight minutes and three nine seconds the exact time predicted when voice contact was regained lovell announced please be informed there is a santa claus to which ken mattingly the capcom replied that s affirmative you are the best ones to know it was christmas day one nine six eight rupes cauchy in eastern mare tranquillitatis unplanned manual re alignment later lovell used some otherwise idle time to do some navigational sightings maneuvering the module to view various stars by using the computer keyboard however an accidental entry erased some of the computer s memory which caused the inertial measuring unit imu to think the module was in the same relative position it had been in before lift off and fire the thrusters to correct the module s attitude once the crew realized why the computer had changed the module s attitude they realized they would have to re enter data that would tell the computer its real position it took lovell ten minutes to figure out the right numbers using the thrusters to get the stars rigel and sirius aligned and another fifteen minutes to enter the corrected data into the computer sixteen months later lovell would once again have to perform a similar manual re alignment under more critical conditions during the apollo one three mission after that module s imu had to be turned off to conserve energy in his one nine nine four book lost moon the perilous voyage of apollo one three later re titled apollo one three when the movie based on it apollo one three came out lovell wrote my training on apollo eight came in handy in that book he dismissed the incident as a planned experiment requested by the ground crew however in subsequent interviews lovell has acknowledged that the incident was an accident caused by his mistake as described in robert zimmerman s one nine nine eight book genesis the story of apollo eight cruise back to earth and re entry the cruise back to earth was mostly a time for the crew to relax and monitor the spacecraft as long as the trajectory specialists had calculated everything correctly the spacecraft would re enter two days after tei and splashdown in the pacific on christmas afternoon the crew made their fifth and final television broadcast this time they gave a tour of the spacecraft showing how an astronaut lived in space when they had finished broadcasting they found a small present from deke slayton in the food locker real turkey with stuffing and three miniature bottles of brandy which remained unopened there were also small presents to the crew from their wives the apollo eight command module on the deck of the uss yorktown after two uneventful days the crew prepared for re entry the computer would control the re entry and all the crew had to do was put the spacecraft in the correct attitude blunt end forward if the computer broke down borman would take over after separating from the service module all the crew could do was sit and wait six minutes before they hit the top of the atmosphere the crew saw the moon rising above the earth s horizon just as had been predicted by the trajectory specialists as they hit the thin outer atmosphere they noticed it was becoming hazy outside as glowing plasma formed around the capsule the capsule started slowing down and the deceleration peaked at six g five nine m s with the computer controlling the descent by changing the attitude of the capsule apollo eight rose briefly like a skipping stone before descending to the ocean at three zero zero zero zero feet nine km the drogue parachute stabilized the spacecraft and was followed at one zero zero zero zero feet three km by the three main parachutes the spacecraft splashdown position was estimated to be when it hit the water the parachutes dragged the spacecraft over and left it upside down in what was termed stable two position as they were buffeted by a one zero foot three m swell borman was sick waiting for the three floatation balloons to right the capsule it was four three minutes after splashdown before the first frogman from the uss yorktown arrived as the capsule had landed before sunrise forty five minutes later they were on the deck of the aircraft carrier the command module is now displayed at the chicago museum of science and industry along with a collection of personal items from the flight donated by lovell and frank borman s spacesuit jim lovell s spacesuit can be found at nasa s glenn research center historical importance apollo eight came at the end of one nine six eight a year that had seen much upheaval around the world soviet tanks had put a stop to the prague spring in czechoslovakia martin luther king jr and robert f kennedy had been assassinated the vietnam war had escalated with the tet offensive university campuses across the united states had seen rioting and occupation of buildings by students may had seen rioting in paris that almost led to revolution yet over all these other events time magazine chose the crew of apollo eight as their men of the year for one nine six eight recognizing them as the people that most influenced events in the preceding year they had been the first people to ever leave the gravitational influence of the earth and orbit another celestial body they had survived a mission that even the crew themselves had rated as only having a fifty fifty chance of fully succeeding the effect of apollo eight can be summed up by a telegram from a stranger received by borman after the mission that simply stated thank you apollo eight you saved one nine six eight january three one nine six nine cover of time magazine with the apollo eight crew one of the most famous aspects of the flight was the earthrise picture that was taken as they came around for their fourth orbit of the moon although it was not the first image taken of the whole earth nor would it be the last this was the first time that humans had taken such a picture some regard the picture as being the start of the environmentalist movement with the first earth day in one nine seven zero the mission was the most widely covered by the media since the first american orbital flight mercury atlas six by john glenn in one nine six two there were one two zero zero journalists covering the mission with the bbc coverage being broadcast in five four countries in one five different languages the soviet newspaper pravda even covered the flight without the usual anti american editorializing it is estimated that a quarter of the people alive at the time saw either live or delayed the christmas eve transmission during the ninth orbit of the moon it had a tremendous impact touring the world after the mission borman met with pope paul vi he was told i have spent my entire life trying to say to the world what you did on christmas eve the militant atheist madalyn murray o hair later caused controversy by bringing a lawsuit against nasa over the reading from genesis she wished the courts to ban us astronauts who were all government employees from public prayer in space this was eventually rejected by the courts but it caused nasa to be skittish about the issue of religion throughout the rest of the apollo program buzz aldrin on apollo one one took communion on the surface of the moon after landing he refrained from mentioning this publicly for several years and only obliquely referred to it at the time crew frank borman flew on gemini seven cassutt michael one nine nine five deke an autobiography forge books isbn zero three one two eight

determining who has achieved human spaceflight vary see edge of space in the united states people who travel above an altitude of five zero miles eight zero km are designated as astronauts the fai

have gone into space international variations by convention a space traveller employed by the russian aviation and space agency or its soviet predecessor is called a cosmonaut cosmonaut is an anglicisation of the russian word kosmonavt which in turn derives from the greek words kosmos universe and nautes sailor in the usa a space traveller is called an astronaut the term derives from the greek words stron star and nautes sailor for the most part cosmonaut and astronaut are synonyms in all languages and the usage of choice is often dictated by political reasons however in the united states the term astronaut is typically applied to the individual as soon as training begins while in russia an individual is not labeled a cosmonaut until successful space flight the first known use of the term was by neil r jones in his short story the death s head meteor in one nine three zero on march one four one nine nine five astronaut norman thagard became the first american to ride to space on board a russian launch vehicle arguably becoming the first american cosmonaut in the process european outside of the uk space travellers are sometimes especially in french speaking countries called spationauts a hybrid word formed from the latin spatium space and greek nautes sailor apart from the soviet union europe has not yet produced manned spacecraft but has sent men and women into space in cooperation with russia and the united states taikonaut is sometimes used in english for astronauts from china by western news media the term was coined in may one nine nine eight by chiew lee yih from malaysia who used it first in newsgroups almost simultaneously chen lan coined it for use in the western media based on the term t ik ng literally great emptiness chinese for space in chinese itself however a single term y h ng yu n universe navigator has long been used for astronauts the closest term using taikong is a colloquialism t ik ng r n space person which refers to people who have actually been in space official english texts issued by the chinese government use astronaut space milestones yuri gagarin valentina tereshkova the first attempt ever in human history to use

phantom cosmonauts astronauts transportation occupations science occupations a modest proposal for preventing the children of poor people in ireland from being a burden to their parents or country and for making them beneficial to the publick commonly referred to as a modest proposal is a satirical pamphlet written by jonathan swift in one seven two nine the work has now become one of the epitomes of satire and the modern phrase a modest proposal derives from the work theme the work is written in first person point of view however the narrator should not be confused with swift himself because the writer is merely a persona he argues through economic reasoning as well as a self righteous moral stance for a way to turn the problem of squalor among the catholics in ireland into its own solution his proposal is to fatten up the undernourished children and feed them to ireland s rich land owners children of the poor could be sold into a meat market at the age of one thus combating overpopulation and unemployment sparing families the expense of child rearing while providing them with a little extra income improving the culinary experience of the wealthy and contributing to the overall economic well being of the nation he offers statistical support for his assertions and gives specific data about the number of children to be sold their weight and price and the projected consumption patterns he suggests some recipes for preparing this delicious new meat and he feels sure that innovative cooks will be quick to generate more he also anticipates that the practice of selling and eating children will have positive effects on family morality husbands will treat their wives with more respect and parents will value their children in ways hitherto unknown his conclusion is that the implementation of this project will do more to solve ireland s complex social political and economic problems than any other measure that has been proposed this is widely believed to be the greatest example of sustained irony in the history of the english language reactions the satirical intent of a modest proposal was misunderstood by many of swift s peers and he was harshly criticized for writing prose in such exceptionally bad taste he came close to losing his patronage because of this essay the misunderstanding of the intent of the satirical attack came about largely because of the disparity between the satirical intent of the cannibalistic proposal and the sincere tone of the narrative voice modern usage in modern usage the phrase modest proposal has come to indicate a proposal that is anything but modest such a proposal may serve to advance a cause or argument by promoting discussion on the merits of the argument s opposite other examples of modest proposals modest proposals and other literary hoaxes report from iron mountain sokal affair miscegenation origin of the word dihydrogen monoxide jack thompson attorney has been criticised for writing

satire essays non fictional british literature one seven two nine books the alkali metals are the series of elements in group one iupac style of the periodic table excluding hydrogen in all but one rare circumstance lithium li sodium na potassium k rubidium rb caesium cs and francium fr they are all highly reactive and are never found in elemental form in nature the alkali metals are silver colored caesium has a golden tinge soft low density metals which react readily with halogens to form ionic salts and with water to form strongly alkaline basic hydroxides these elements all have one electron in their outermost shell so the energetically preferred state of achieving a filled electron shell is to lose one electron to form a singly charged positive ion hydrogen with a solitary electron is sometimes placed at the top of group one but it is not an alkali metal except under extreme circumstances as metallic hydrogen rather it exists naturally as a diatomic gas removal of its single electron requires considerably more energy than removal of the outer electron for the alkali metals as in the halogens only one additional electron is required to fill in the outermost shell of the hydrogen atom so hydrogen can in some circumstances behave like a halogen forming the negative hydride ion binary compounds of hydride with the alkali metals and some transition metals have been prepared under extremely high pressure such as is found at the core of jupiter hydrogen does become metallic and behaves like an alkali metal see metallic hydrogen alkali metals periodic table in logic the argument form or test form of an argument results from replacing the different words or sentences that make up the argument with letters along the lines of algebra the letters represent logical variables the sentence forms which classify argument forms of common arguments important are studied in college logic here is an example of an argument a all humans are mortal socrates is human therefore socrates is mortal we can rewrite argument a by putting each sentence on its own line b all humans are mortal socrates is human therefore socrates is mortal to demonstrate the important notion of the form of an argument substitute letters for similar items throughout b c all s are p a is s therefore a is p all we have done in c is to put s for human and humans p for mortal and a for socrates what results c is the form of the original argument in a so argument form c is the form of argument a moreover each individual sentence of c is the sentence form of its respective sentence in a attention is given to argument and sentence form because form is what makes an argument valid or cogent some examples of valid arguments forms are modus ponens modus tollens and the disjunctive syllogism two invalid argument forms are affirming the consequent and denying the antecedent see also analytic proposition synthetic proposition logic an alphabet is a complete standardized set of letters basic written symbols each of which roughly represents a phoneme of a spoken language either as it exists now or as it may have been in the past there are other systems of writing such as logograms in which each symbol represents a morpheme or word and syllabaries in which each symbol represents a syllable the word alphabet itself comes from alpha and beta the first two symbols of the greek alphabet there are dozens of alphabets in use today most of them are linear which means that they are made up of lines notable exceptions are the braille alphabet morse code and the cuneiform alphabet of the ancient city of ugarit types the term alphabet is currently used by linguists both in a wider and in a narrower sense in the wider sense the term refers to any script that is segmental on the phoneme level i e that has separate glyphs for individual sounds and not for larger units such as syllables or words in the narrower sense some scholars distinguish true alphabets from two other subtypes abjads and abugidas the three types differ from each other in the way vowels are treated in relation to consonants abjads record only consonants and leave vowels or most vowels unexpressed in abugidas the vowels are indicated by diacritical marks or systematic modification of the form of the consonants in alphabets in the narrow sense both consonants and vowels have separate symbols the first alphabet in the wider sense was the proto canaanite alphabet an abjad which through its successor phoenician became the ancestor of all later alphabets the first alphabet in the narrow sense was the greek alphabet examples of present day abjads are the arabic and hebrew scripts true alphabets include latin cyrillic and korean hangul and abugidas are used to write amharic hindi and thai the canadian aboriginal syllabics are also an abugida rather than a syllabary as a glyph stands for a consonant and is rotated to represent the vowel rather than each consonant vowel combination being represented by a separate glyph as in a true syllabary the boundaries between these three types are not always clear cut for example iraqi kurdish is written in the arabic script which is normally an abjad however in kurdish writing the vowels is mandatory and full letters are used so the script is a true alphabet other languages may use a semitic abjad with mandatory vowel diacritics effectively making them abugidas on the other hand the phagspa script of the mongol empire was based closely on the tibetan abugida but all vowel marks were written after the preceding consonant rather than as diacritic marks although short a was not written as in the abugidas one could argue that the linear arrangement made this a true alphabet conversely the vowel marks of the amharic abugida have been so completely assimilated into their consonants that the system is learned as a syllabary rather than as a segmental script even more extreme the pahlavi abjad became logographic see below thus the primary classification of alphabets reflects how they treat vowels for tonal languages further classification can be based on the treatment of tone though there are as yet no names to distinguish the various types some alphabets disregard tone entirely especially when it does not carry a heavy functional load as in somali and many other languages of africa and the americas such scripts are to tone what abjads are to vowels most commonly tones are indicated with diacritics the way vowels are treated in abugidas this is the case for vietnamese a true alphabet and thai an abugida in thai tone is determined primarily by the choice of consonant with diacritics for disambiguation in the pollard script an abugida vowels are indicated by diacritics but the placement of the vowel relative to the consonant indicates the tone more rarely a script has separate letters for the tones as is the case for hmong and zhuang for many of these languages regardless of whether letters or diacritics are used the most common tone is not marked just as the most common vowel is not marked in indic abugidas alphabets can be quite small the book pahlavi script an abjad had only twelve letters at one point and may have had even fewer later on today the rotokas alphabet has only twelve letters the hawaiian alphabet is sometimes claimed to be as small but it actually consists of one eight letters including the okina and five long vowels while rotokas has a small alphabet because it has few phonemes to represent just eleven book pahlavi was small because many letters had been conflated that is the graphic distinctions had been lost over time and diacritics were not developed to compensate for this as they were in arabic another script that lost many of its distinct letter shapes for example a comma shaped letter represented g d y k and j however such simplifications can perversely make a script more complicated in later pahlavi papyri up to half of the remaining graphic distinctions were lost and the script could no longer be read as a sequence of letters at all but had to be learned as word symbols that is as logograms like egyptian demotic the largest segmental script is probably an abugida devanagari when written in devanagari vedic sanskrit has an alphabet of five three letters including the visarga mark for final aspiration and special letters for k and j though one of the letters is theoretical and not actually used the hindi alphabet must represent both sanskrit and modern vocabulary and so has been expanded to five eight with the khutma letters letters with a dot added to represent sounds from persian and english the largest known abjad is sindhi with five one letters the largest true alphabets include kabardian and abxaz for cyrillic with five eight and five six letters respectively and slovak for the latin alphabet with four six however these scripts either include di and tri graphs similar to spanish ch or diacritics like slovak the largest true alphabet where each letter is graphically independent is probably georgian with four one letters syllabaries typically include five zero to four zero zero glyphs though the m ra pirah language of brazil would require only two four if tone were not indicated and rotokas three zero and the glyphs of logographic systems number from the hundreds to the thousands thus a simple count of the number of distinct symbols is an important clue to the nature of an unknown script it is not always clear what constitutes a distinct alphabet french uses the same basic alphabet as english but many of the letters can carry diacritic and other marks for example or in french these marks are not considered to create additional letters however in icelandic the accented letters such as and are considered distinct letters of the alphabet some adaptations of the latin alphabet are augmented with ligatures such as in old english and in algonquian by borrowings from other alphabets such as the thorn in old english and icelandic which came from the futhark runes and by modifying existing letters such as the eth of old english and icelandic which came from d other alphabets only use a subset of the latin alphabet such as hawaiian or italian which only uses the letters j k x y and w for foreign words spelling each language may establish certain general rules that govern the association between letters and phonemes but depending on the language these rules may or may not be consistently followed in a perfectly phonological alphabet the phonemes and letters would correspond perfectly in two directions a writer could predict the spelling of a word given its pronunciation and a speaker could predict the pronunciation of a word given its spelling however languages often evolve independently of their writing systems and writing systems have been borrowed for languages they were not designed for so the degree to which letters of an alphabet correspond to phonemes of a language varies greatly from one language to another and even within a single language languages may fail to achieve a one to one correspondence between letters and sounds in any of several ways a language may represent a given phoneme with a combination of letters rather than just a single letter two letter combinations are called digraphs and three letter groups are called trigraphs kabardian uses a tesseragraph four letters for one of its phonemes a language may represent the same phoneme with two different letters or combinations of letters a language may spell some words with unpronounced letters that exist for historical or other reasons pronunciation of individual words may change according to the presence of surrounding words in a sentence different dialects of a language may use different phonemes for the same word a language may use different sets of symbols or different rules for distinct sets of vocabulary items such as the japanese hiragana and katakana syllabaries or the various rules in english for spelling words from latin and greek or the original germanic vocabulary national languages generally elect to address the problem of dialects by simply associating the alphabet with the national standard however with an international language with wide variations in its dialects such as english it would be impossible to represent the language in all its variations with a single phonetic alphabet some national languages like finnish have a very regular spelling system with a nearly one to one correspondence between letters and phonemes the italian verb corresponding to spell compitare is unknown to many italians because the act of spelling itself is almost never needed each phoneme of standard italian is represented in only one way however pronunciation cannot always be predicted from spelling because certain letters are pronounced in more than one way in standard spanish it is possible to tell the pronunciation of a word from its spelling but not vice versa this is because certain phonemes can be represented in more than one way but a given letter is consistently pronounced french with its silent letters and its heavy use of nasal vowels and elision may seem to lack much correspondence between spelling and pronunciation but its rules on pronunciation are actually consistent and predictable with a fair degree of accuracy at the other extreme however are languages such as english and irish where the spelling of many words simply has to be memorized as they do not correspond to sounds in a consistent way for english this is because the great vowel shift occurred after the orthography was established and because english has acquired a large number of loanwords at different times retaining their original spelling at varying levels however even english has general rules that predict pronunciation from spelling and these rules are successful most of the time the sounds of speech of all languages of the world can be written by a rather small universal phonetic alphabet a standard for this is the international phonetic alphabet collation an alphabet also serves to establish an order among letters that can be used for sorting entries in lists called collating note that the order does not have to be constant among different languages using this alphabet for examples see latin alphabet collating in other languages in recent years the unicode initiative has attempted to collate most of the world s known writing systems into a single character encoding as well as its primary purpose of standardising computer processing of non roman scripts the unicode project has provided a focus for script related scholarship the alphabet effect some communication theorists notably those associated with the so called toronto school of communications such as marshall mcluhan harold innis and more recently robert k logan have advanced hypotheses to the effect that alphabetic scripts in particular have served to promote and encourage the skills of analysis coding decoding and classification this set of hypotheses may be known as the alphabet effect after the title of logan s one nine eight six work the theory claims that a greater level of abstraction is required due to the greater economy of symbols in alphabetic systems and this abstraction needed to interpret phonemic symbols in turn has contributed in some way to the development of the societies which use it proponents of this theory hold that the development of alphabetic as distinct to other types of writing systems has made a significant impact on western thinking and development because it introduced a new level of abstraction analysis and classification mcluhan and logan one nine seven seven postulates that as a result of these skills the use of the alphabet created an environment conducive to the development of codified law monotheism abstract science deductive logic objective history and individualism according to logan all of these innovations including the alphabet arose within the very narrow geographic zone between the tigris euphrates river system and the aegean sea and within the very narrow time frame between two zero zero zero b c and five zero zero b c logan two zero zero four however many of these abstractions first occurred in societies which did not use an alphabet such as the codified law of hammurabi in babylonia which predated similar codes in societies with the alphabet since the alphabet quickly spread to become nearly ubiquitous it is

an atom of neutral charge the number of electrons also equals the atomic number the atomic number originally meant the number of an element s place in the periodic table when mendeleyev arranged the known chemical elements grouped by their similarities in chemistry it was noticeable that placing them in strict order of atomic mass resulted in some mismatches iodine and tellurium if listed by atomic mass appeared to be in the wrong order and would fit better if their places in the table were swapped placing them in the order which fit chemical properties most closely their number in the table was their atomic number this number appeared to be approximately proportional to the mass of the atom but as the discrepancy showed reflected some other property than mass the anomalies in this sequence were finally explained after research by henry gwyn jeffreys moseley in one nine one three moseley discovered a strict relationship between the x ray diffraction spectra of elements and their correct location in the periodic table it was later shown that the atomic number corresponds to the electric charge of the nucleus in other words the number of protons it is the charge which gives elements their chemical properties rather than the atomic mass the atomic number is closely related to the mass number although they should not be confused which is the number of protons and neutrons

furthermore anatomy can be covered either regionally or systemically that is studying anatomy by bodily regions such as the head and chest for the former or studying by specific systems such as the nervous or respiratory systmes for the latter major branches of anatomy include comparative anatomy histology and human anatomy animal anatomy animal anatomy may include the study of the structure of different animals when it is called comparative anatomy or animal morphology or it may be limited to one animal only in which case it is spoken of as special anatomy human anatomy from a utilitarian point of view the study of humans is the most important division of special anatomy and this human anatomy may be approached from different points of view from that of medicine it consists of a knowledge of the exact form position size and relationship of the various structures of the healthy human body and to this study the term descriptive or topographical human anatomy is given though it is often less happily spoken of as anthropotomy so intricate is the human body that only a small number of professional human anatomists after years of patient observation are complete masters of all its details most of them specialize on certain parts such as the brain or viscera contenting themselves with a good working knowledge of the rest topographical anatomy must be learned by repeated dissection and inspection of dead human bodies it is no more a science than a pilot s knowledge is and like that knowledge must be exact and available in moments of emergency from the morphological point of view however human anatomy is a scientific and fascinating study having for its object the discovery of the causes which have brought about the existing structure of humans and needing a knowledge of the allied sciences of embryology or developmental biology phylogeny and histology pathological anatomy or morbid anatomy is the study of diseased organs while sections of normal anatomy applied to various purposes receive special names such as medical surgical gynaecological artistic and superficial anatomy the comparison of the anatomy of different races of humans is part of the science of physical anthropology or anthropological anatomy in the present edition of this work the subject of anatomy is treated systematically rather than topographically each anatomical article contains first a description of the structures of an organ or system such as nerves arteries heart and so forth as it is found in humans this is followed by an account of the development embryology and comparative anatomy morphology as far as vertebrate animals are concerned but only those parts of the lower animals which are of interest in explaining human body structure are here dealt with the articles have a twofold purpose first to give enough details of structure to make the articles on physiology surgery medicine and pathology intelligible and secondly to give the non expert inquirer or

assuming the converse of a statement to be true the fallacy of affirming the consequent occurs when a hypothetical proposition comprising an antecedent and a consequent asserts that the truthhood of the consequent implies the truthhood of the antecedent this is fallacious because it assumes a bidirectionality when it does not necessarily exist this fallacy has the following argument form if p then q q therefore p this logical error is called the fallacy of affirming the consequent because it is mistakenly concluded from the second premise that the affirmation of the consequent entails the truthhood of the antecedent one way to demonstrate the invalidity is to use a counterexample here is an argument that is obviously incorrect if stephen king wrote the bible p then stephen king is a good writer q stephen king is a good writer q therefore stephen king wrote the bible p the previous argument was obviously incorrect but the next argument may be more deceiving if someone is human p then she is mortal q anna is mortal q therefore anna is human p but in fact anna can be a cat very much a mortal but not a human one however be aware that a similar argument form is valid in which the first premise asserts if and only if rather than if similarly the converse of a statement can be validly assumed to be true so long as the if and only if phrase is attached see also modus ponens modus

biography tarkovsky son of the prominent poet arseniy tarkovsky was a product of the golden era of soviet arts education he received a classical education in moscow studying music and arabic before training for over five years at the vgik film school studying directly under mikhail romm among others he also worked as a geologist in siberia although the orthodox christian symbolism of his films led to prevarication and occasional suppression of the finished product by the soviet authorities the soviet mosfilm studio system enabled him to make films that would not have been commercially viable in the west however tarkovsky s principal complaint about his treatment by the authorities was that he had many more ideas in him than he was allowed to bring to the screen and in one nine

characterised by metaphysical themes extremely long takes and memorable images of exceptional beauty recurring motifs in his films are dreams memory childhood running water accompanied by fire rain indoors reflections and characters re appearing in the foreground of long panning movements of the camera tarkovsky developed a theory of cinema that he called sculpting in time by this he meant that the unique characteristic of cinema as a medium was to take our experience of time and alter it unedited movie footage transcribes time in real time the speedy jump cutting style that is prevalent in mtv videos and hollywood movies by contrast overrides any sense of time by imposing the editor s viewpoint by using long takes and few cuts in his films he aimed to give the viewers a sense of time passing time lost and the relationship of one moment in time to another up to and including his film mirror tarkovsky focused his cinematic works on exploring this theory after mirror he announced that he would focus his work on exploring the dramatic unities proposed by aristotle a concentrated action happening in one place within the span of a single day the sacrifice is the only film that truly reflects this ambition it is also considered by many to be a near perfect reflection of the sculpting in time theory filmography the killers one nine five eight tarkovsky s first student film at

four a word phrase sentence or other communication is called ambiguous if it can be interpreted in more than one way ambiguity is distinct from vagueness which arises when the boundaries of meaning are indistinct lexical ambiguity arises when context is insufficient to determine the sense of a single word that has more than one meaning for example the word bank has several meanings including financial institution and edge of a river but if someone says i deposited one zero zero in the bank the intended meaning is clear more problematic are words whose senses express closely related concepts good for example can mean useful or functional that s a good hammer exemplary she s a good student pleasing this is good soup moral he is a good person and probably other similar things i have a good daughter isn t clear about which sense is intended syntactic ambiguity arises when a sentence can be parsed in more than one way he ate the cookies on the couch for example could mean that he ate those cookies which were on the couch as opposed to those that were on the table or it could mean that he was sitting on the couch when he ate the cookies spoken language can also contain lexical ambiguities where there is more than one way to break up a set of sounds into words for example ice cream and i scream this is rarely a problem due to the use of context philosophers and other users of logic spend a lot of time and effort searching for and removing ambiguity in arguments because it can lead to incorrect conclusions and can be used to deliberately conceal bad arguments for example a politician might say i oppose taxes which hinder economic growth some will think he opposes taxes in general because they hinder economic growth others will think he opposes only those taxes that he believes will hinder economic growth although in writing the correct insertion or omission of a comma after taxes removes ambiguity here the politician hopes that each will interpret the statement in the way he wants and both will think the politician is on his side the logical fallacies of amphiboly and equivocation also rely on the use of ambiguous words and phrases in literature and rhetoric on the other hand ambiguity can be a useful tool groucho marx s classic joke depends on a grammatical ambiguity for its humor for example last night i shot an elephant in my pajamas what he was doing in my pajamas i ll never know songs and poetry often rely on ambiguous words for artistic effect as in the song title don t it make my brown eyes blue where blue can refer to the color or to sadness in narrative ambiguty can be introduced in several ways motive plot character f scott fitzgerald uses the latter type of ambiguity with notable effect in his novel the great gatsby in music

afrikaans dutch for earth pig aarde earth varken pig because early settlers from europe thought it resembled a pig although aardvarks are not closely related to pigs the aardvark is the only surviving member of the family orycteropodidae and of the order tubulidentata the aardvark was originally placed in the same genus as the south american anteaters because of superficial similarities which it is now known are the result of convergent evolution not common ancestry for the same reason aardvarks bear a striking first glance resemblance to the marsupial bilbies and bandicoots of australasia which are not placental mammals at all the oldest known tubulidentata fossils have been found in kenya and date to the early miocene although the relationships of tubulidentata are unknown they are probably ungulates they spread to europe and southern asia during the later miocene and early pliocene periods three genera of the family orycteropodidae are known leptorycteropus myorycteropus and orycteropus the surviving aardvark a genus from madagascar may be related to them called plesiorycteropus the most distinctive characteristic of the tubulidentata is as the name implies their teeth which instead of having a pulp cavity have lots of thin tubes of dentine each containing pulp and held together by cementum the teeth have no enamel coating and are worn away and regrow continuously aardvarks are born with conventional incisors and canines at the front of the jaw but these fall out and are not replaced in adult aardvarks the only teeth are the molars at the back of the jaw aardvark aardvarks are only vaguely pig like the body is stout with an arched back the limbs are of moderate length the front feet have lost the pollex or thumb resulting in four toes but the rear feet have all five toes each toe bears a large robust nail which is somewhat flattened and shovel like and appears to be intermediate between a claw and a hoof the ears are disproportionately long and the tail very thick at the base with a gradual taper the greatly elongated head is set on a short thick neck and at the end of the snout is a disk in which the nostrils open the mouth is typical of species that feed on termites small and tubular aardvarks have long thin protrusible tongues and elaborate structures supporting a keen sense of smell weight is typically between four zero and six five kg length

have been known to sleep in a recently excavated ant nest so well does it protect them in the past several individual species of aardvark were named however current knowledge indicates that there is only one species orycteropus afer with several subspecies one eight have been listed but most are regarded as invalid aardvarks are nocturnal and solitary creatures that feed almost exclusively on ants and termites an aardvark emerges from its burrow in the late afternoon or shortly after sunset and forages over a considerable home range swinging its long nose from side to side to pick up the scent of food when a concentration of ants or termites is found the aardvark digs into it with its powerful front legs keeping its long ears upright to listen for predators and takes up an astonishing number of insects with its long sticky tongue as many as five zero zero zero zero in one night has been recorded they are exceptionally fast diggers but otherwise move rather slowly aside from digging out ants and termites aardvarks also excavate burrows to live in temporary sites scattered around the home range as refuges and the main burrow which is used for breeding main burrows can be deep and extensive have several entrances and be one three m long aardvarks change the layout of their home burrow regularly and from time to time move on and make a new one only mothers and young share burrows after a gestation period of seven months a single young weighing around two kg is born and is able to leave the burrow to accompany its mother after only two weeks at six months of age it is digging its own burrows but it will often remain with the mother until the next mating season aardvarks can grow older than two zero years in captivity aardvarks are distributed across most of sub

renewal of the surface coating of an adobe wall in chamisal new mexico adobe is a building material composed of water sandy clay and straw or other organic materials which is shaped into bricks using wooden frames and dried in the sun also known as mudbrick adobe structures are extremely durable and account for the oldest extant buildings on the planet adobe buildings also offer significant advantages in hot dry climates as they remain cooler as it stores and releases heat very slowly the word adobe is spanish and comes from the arabic at tub the brick and from the coptic tobe the word may be pronounced ah doh beh or uh doh bee buildings made of sun dried earth are common in the middle east north africa and in spain usually in the mudejar style the method of brickmaking was imported to the americas in the one six th century by spaniards a distinction is sometimes made between the smaller adobes which are about the size of ordinary baked bricks and the larger adobines some of which are as much as from one to two yards long in more modern usage the term adobe has come to mean a style of architecture that is popular in the desert climates of north america especially in new mexico cf stucco detail of adobe kilns in arizona composition of adobe an adobe brick is made of soil mixed with water and an organic material such as straw or animal dung the soil composition

bricks are made in an open frame two five cm one zero inches by three six cm one four inches is a reasonable size but any convenient size is fine for your own use after the mud is put into the frame the frame is removed after a few hours the bricks are put on edge to finish drying bricks should be dried in the shade to avoid cracking use the same mixture you use to make bricks for mortar when laying the bricks and for plaster on the interior and exterior walls some ancient cultures used concrete for the plaster to avoid rain damage it is sometimes useful to include occasional pieces of wood as you lay a wall to give something to nail insulation onto and stone can be used for additional strength the largest structure ever made from adobe bricks was the bam citadel which suffered

be transferred through the wall by evening such a wall can be covered with glass to increase heat collection used in a passive solar home such a wall is called a trombe wall adobe has a large thermal

of a large botanical genus of the same name belonging to the family agavaceae chiefly mexican they occur also in the southern and western united states and in central and tropical south america the plants have a large rosette of thick fleshy leaves generally ending in a sharp point and with a spiny margin the stout stem is usually short the leaves apparently springing from the root each rosette is monocarpic and grows slowly to flower but once after a number of years when a tall stem or mast grows from the center of the leaf rosette and bears a large number of shortly tubular flowers after development of fruit the original plant dies but suckers are frequently produced from the base of the stem which become new plants swan s neck agave agave attenuata the most familiar species is agave americana a native of tropical america the so called century plant or american aloe the maguey of mexico the name refers to the long time the plant takes to flower although the number of years before flowering occurs depends on the vigor of the individual the richness of the soil and the climate during these years the plant is storing in its fleshy leaves the nourishment required for the effort of flowering during the development of the inflorescence there is a rush of sap to the base of the young flowerstalk in the case of a americana and other species this is used by the mexicans to make their national beverage pulque the flower shoot is cut out and the sap collected and subsequently fermented by distillation a spirit called mezcal is prepared the leaves of several species yield fiber as for instance agave rigida var sisalana sisal hemp agave decipiens false sisal hemp agave americana is the source of pita fiber and is used as a fiber plant in mexico the west indies and southern europe the flowering stem of the last named dried and cut in slices forms natural razor strops and the expressed juice of the leaves will lather in water like soap the native americans of mexico used the agave both to make pens nails and needles as well as string to sew and make weavings in india the plant is extensively used for hedges along railroads agave in bloom in a garden roquevaire bouches du rh ne france september one nine seven eight agave americana century plant was introduced into europe about the middle of the one six th century and is now widely cultivated for its handsome appearance in the variegated forms the leaf has a white or yellow marginal or central stripe from base to apex as the leaves unfold from the center of the rosette the impression of the marginal spines is very conspicuous on the still erect younger leaves the tequ plants are usually grown in tubs and put out in the summer months but in the winter require protection from frost they mature very slowly and die after flowering but are easily propagated by the offsets from the base of the stem agave nectar has been used as an alternative to sugar in cooking the juice from many species of agave can cause acute contact dermatitis it will produce reddening and blistering lasting one to two weeks episodes of itching may recur up to a year thereafter even though there is no longer a visible rash interestingly dried parts of the plants can be handled with bare hands with little or no effect taxonomy agaves were once classified in liliaceae but most references now include them in their own family agavaceae agaves have long presented special difficulties for taxonomy variations within a species may be considerable and a number of named species are of unknown origin and may just be variants of original wild species spanish and portuguese explorers probably brought agaves back with them but really became popular in europe during the one nine th century with many types being imported by collectors some of have been continuously propagated by offset since then and do not consistently resemble any species known in nature although this may simply be due to the unnatural

virginica false aloe king s american dispensatory henriette s herbal botanical dermatology database information on agave contact dermatitis agavaceae poisonous plants dermatology asia is the largest and most populous region or continent depending on the definition it is traditionally defined as part of the landmass of africa eurasia lying east of the suez canal east of the ural mountains and south of the caucasus mountains and the caspian and black seas about six zero of the world s human population lives in asia of whom only two live in the northern and interior half siberia mongolia kazakhstan xinjiang tibet qinghai western uzbekistan and turkmenistan the other nine eight live in the remaining half world map showing asia etymology the word asia entered english via latin from ancient greek asia see also list of traditional greek place names this name is first attested in herodotus c four four zero bc where it refers to asia minor or for the purposes of describing the persian wars to the persian empire as opposed to greece and egypt herodotus comments that he is puzzled as to why three different women s names are used to describe a single land mass europa asia and libya referring to africa stating that most greeks assumed that asia was named after the wife of prometheus but that the lydians say it was named after asias son of cotys who passed the name on to a tribe in sardis even before herodotus homer knew of a trojan ally named asios son of hyrtacus a ruler over several towns and elsewhere he describes a marsh as iliad two four six one the greek term may be derived from assuwa a one four th century bc confederation of states in western anatolia hittite assu good is probably an element in that name alternatively the ultimate etymology of the term may be from the akkadian word w a m cognate of hebrew which means to go out or to ascend referring to the direction of the sun at sunrise in the middle east and also likely connected with the phoenician word asa meaning east this may be contrasted to a similar etymology proposed for europe as being from semitic er bu to enter or set of the sun however an originally mesopotamian or middle eastern perspective would not explain how the term asia first came to be associated with anatolia as lying west of the semitic speaking area definition and boundaries political map of asia medieval europeans considered asia as a continent a distinct landmass the european concept of the three continents in the old world goes back to classical antiquity with the etymology of the word rooted in the ancient near and middle east the demarcation between asia and africa is the isthmus of suez and the red sea the boundary between asia and europe is commonly believed to run through the dardanelles the sea of marmara the bosporus the black sea the caucasus mountains the caspian sea the ural river to its source and the ural mountains to the kara sea near kara russia however modern discovery of the extent of africa and asia made this definition rather anachronistic especially in the case of asia which would have several regions that would be considered distinct landmasses if these criteria were used for example south asia and east asia geologists and physical geographers no longer consider asia and europe to be separate continents it is either defined in terms of geological landmasses physical geography or tectonic plates geology in the former case europe is a western peninsula of eurasia or the africa eurasia landmass in the latter europe and asia are still part of the eurasian plate which excludes the arabian and indian tectonic plates in human geography there are two schools of thought one school follows historical convention and treats europe and asia as different continents categorizing europe east asia the orient south asia british india and the middle east arabia and persia as specific regions for more detailed analysis the other schools equate the word continent in terms of geographical region when referring to europe and use the term region to describe asia in terms of physical geography because in linguistic terms continent implies a distinct landmass it is becoming increasingly common to substitute the term region for continent to avoid the problem of disambiguation altogether there is much confusion in european languages with the term asian because a category implies homogenity the term asian almost always refers to a subcategory of people from asia rather than referring to asian defined in term of asia the fact that in american english asian refers to east asian orientals while in british english asian refers to south asian reflects this confusion sometimes it is not even clear exactly what asia consists of some definitions exclude turkey the middle east and or russia the term is sometimes used more strictly in reference to asia pacific which does not include the middle east or russia but does include islands in the pacific ocean a number of which may also be considered part of australasia and or oceania asia contains the indian subcontinent arabian subcontinent as well as a piece of the north american plate in siberia geographical regions satellite view of asia as already mentioned asia is a subregion of eurasia for further subdivisions based on that term see north eurasia and central eurasia some asian countries stretch beyond asia see bicontinental country for details about the borderline cases between asia and europe asia and africa and asia and oceania the following subregions of asia are traditionally recognized central asia east asia far east north asia south asia or indian subcontinent southeast asia southwest asia or middle east or west asia central asia there is no absolute consensus in the usage of this term usually central asia includes the central asian republics of kazakhstan excluding its small european territory uzbekistan tajikistan turkmenistan and kyrgyzstan afghanistan mongolia and the western regions of china are also sometimes included former soviet states in the caucasus region central asia is currently geopolitically important because international disputes and conflicts over oil pipelines nagorno karabakh and chechnya as well as the presence of u s military and u k military forces in afghanistan east asia this area includes the pacific ocean island countries of taiwan and japan north and south korea on the korean peninsula china but sometimes only the eastern regions sometimes the nations of mongolia and vietnam are also included in east asia more informally southeast asia is included in east asia on some occasions north asia this term is rarely used by geographers but usually it refers to the bigger asian part of russia also known as siberia sometimes the northern parts of other asian nations such as kazakhstan are also included in northern asia south asia or indian subcontinent south asia is also referred to as the indian subcontinent it includes the himalayan states of india pakistan nepal bhutan and bangladesh the indian ocean nations of sri lanka and the maldives india s andaman nicobar and lakshadweep islands also lie in the indian ocean the peninsular india also known as the deccan plateau sometimes afghanistan is also included into this category southeast asia this region contains the malay peninsula indochina and islands in the indian ocean and pacific ocean the countries it contains are in mainland southeast asia the countries myanmar thailand laos cambodia and vietnam in maritime southeast asia the countries of malaysia brunei the philippines singapore and indonesia some of the indonesian islands also lie in the melanesia region of oceania east timor also melanesian is sometimes included too the country of malaysia is divided in two by the south china sea and thus has both a mainland and island part southwest asia or middle east near east or west asia this can also be called by the western term middle east which is commonly used by europeans and americans middle east to some interpretations is often used to also refer to some countries in north africa southwest asia can be further divided into anatolia i e asia minor constituting the asian part of turkey the island nation of cyprus in the mediterranean sea the levant or near east which includes syria israel jordan lebanon iraq and the asian portion of egypt the arabian peninsula including saudi arabia united arab emirates bahrain qatar oman yemen and kuwait the caucasus region which straddles both asia and europe namely transcaucasia including a small portion of russia and arguably most if not all of georgia armenia and azerbaijan the iranian plateau containing iran and parts of other neighbouring nations economy in terms of gross domestic product ppp the largest national economy within asia is that of the prc people s republic of china over the last decade china s and india s economies have been growing rapidly both with an average annual growth rate above seven prc is the world s second largest economy after the us followed by japan and india as the world s third and fourth largest economies respectively then followed by the european nations germany u k france and italy in terms of exchange rates nominal gdp however japan has the largest economy in asia and second largest of any single nation in the world after surpassing the soviet union measured in net material product in one nine eight six and germany in one nine six eight nb a number of supernational economies are larger such as the eu nafta or apec economic growth in asia since world war ii to the one nine nine zero s had been concentrated in few countries of the pacific rim and has spread more recently to other regions in the late eight zero s and early nine zero s japan s economy was almost as large as that of the rest of the continent combined in one nine nine five japan s economy nearly equalled the usa to tie the largest economy in the world for a day after the japanese currency reached a record high of seven nine yen however since then japan s currency has corrected and china has grown to be the second largest asian economy followed by india in

agriculture especially of rice allows high population density of countries in the warm and humid area other main agricultural products include wheat and chicken forestry is extensive throughout asia except southwest and central asia fishing is a major source of food in asia particularly in japan manufacturing manufacturing in asia has traditionally been strongest in east and southeast asia particularly in prc taiwan japan south korea and singapore the industry varies from manufacturing cheap goods such as toys to high tech goods such as computers and cars many companies from europe north america and japan have significant operations in the developing asia to take avantage of its abundant supply of cheap labor one of the major employers in manufacturing in asia is the textile industry much of the world s supply of clothing and footwear now originates in southeast asia financial and other services asia has three main financial centers they are in hong kong singapore and tokyo call centers are becoming major employers in india and the philippines due to the availablity of many well educated english speakers the rise of the business process outsourcing industry has seen the rise of india and china as the other financial centers early history map of asia one eight nine two the history of asia can be seen as the distinct histories of several peripheral coastal regions linked by the interior mass of the central asian steppe the coastal periphery was home to some of the world s earliest known civilizations each of them developing around fertile river valleys the civilizations in mesopotamia the indus valley and the yangtze shared many similarities and may well have exchanged technologies and ideas such as mathematics and the wheel other innovations such as that of writing seem to have been developed individually in each area cities states and empires developed in these lowlands the central steppe region had long been inhabited by horse mounted nomads and from the steppes they could reach all areas of asia the earliest postulated expansion out of the steppe is that of the indo europeans who spread their languages into the middle east india and in the tocharians to the borders of china the northernmost part of asia including much of siberia was largely inaccessible to the steppe nomads owing to the dense forests the climate and the tundra these areas remained very sparsely populated the centre and the peripheries were mostly kept separated by mountains and deserts the caucasus and himalaya mountains and the karakum and gobi deserts formed barriers that the steppe horsemen could cross only with difficulty while technologically and socially the urban city dwellers were more advanced in many cases they could do little militarily to defend against the mounted hordes of the steppe however the lowlands did not have enough open grasslands to support a large horsebound force for this and other reasons the nomads who conquered states in china india and the middle east often found themselves adapting to the local more affluent societies population density the following table lists countries and dependencies by population density in inhabitants and km two unlike the figures in the country articles the figures in this table are based on areas including inland water bodies lakes reservoirs rivers and may therefore be lower here the whole of egypt russia kazakhstan georgia azerbaijan and turkey are referred to in the table although they may be considered to be only partly in asia asia also contains about six zero of the world s

century later left the arawaks to graze livestock using the island as a source of meat for other dutch possessions in the caribbean the arawak heritage is stronger on aruba than on most caribbean islands no full blooded indians remain but the features of the islanders clearly indicate their genetic heritage the majority of the population is descended from arawak dutch and spanish ancestors

articles of confederation and perpetual union commonly known as the articles of confederation was the first governing document of the united states of america the articles which combined the one three colonies of the american revolutionary war into a loose confederation were adopted by the second continental congress on november one five one seven seven seven after one six months of debate the articles were ratified three years later on march one one seven eight one the articles were eventually replaced by the united states constitution on june two one one seven eight eight when the ninth state new hampshire ratified the constitution according to their own terms for modification however the articles were still in effect until one seven nine zero when every one of the one three states had ratified the new constitution ratification the articles of confederation were submitted to the states for ratification on november one seven one seven seven seven accompanied by a letter from congress urging that the document be candidly reviewed under a sense of the difficulty of combining in one general system the various sentiments and interests of a continent divided into so many sovereign and independent communities under a conviction of the absolute necessity of uniting all our councils and all our strength to maintain and defend our common liberties the document only became effective as it was ratified by the states this process dragged on for several years stalled by an interstate quarrel over claims to uncolonized land in the west maryland was the last hold out it refused to ratify until virginia and new york agreed to rescind their claims to lands in the ohio river valley all of the colonies rebelling against britain ratified it by one seven eight one although congress debated the articles for over a year it requested immediate action on the part of the states on february five one seven seven eight south carolina became the first state to ratify the articles of confederation however three and a half years passed before the final ratification by maryland on march one one seven eight one article summaries even though the articles of confederation and the constitution were established by much of the same people they were still very different the document contained one three articles a conclusion and a signatory section establishes the name of the confederation as the united states of america explains the rights possessed by any state and the amount of power to which any state is entitled establishes the united states as a league of states united for their common defense the security of their liberties and their mutual and general welfare binding themselves to assist each other against all force offered to or attacks made upon them establishes freedom of movement anyone can pass freely between states excluding paupers vagabonds and fugitives from justice excepted all people are entitled to the rights established by the state into which he or she travels if a crime is committed in one state and the perpetrator flees to another state he will be extradited to and tried in the state in which the crime was committed allocates one vote in the congress of the confederation united states in congress assembled to each state which was entitled to a delegation of between two and seven members members of congress were appointed by state legislatures individuals could not serve more than three out of any six years limits the powers of states to conduct foreign relations and to declare war when an army is raised for common defense colonels and military ranks below colonel will be named by the state legislatures expenditures by the united states will be paid by funds raised by state legislatures and apportioned to the states based on the real property values of each defines the rights of the central government to declare war to set weights and measures including coins and for congress to serve as a final court for disputes between states defines a committee of the states to be a government when congress is not in session requires nine states to approve the admission of a new state into the confederacy preapproves canada if they apply for membership reaffirms that the confederation accepts war debt incurred by congress before the articles assumption declares that the articles are perpetual and can only be altered by approval of congress with ratification by all the state legislatures still at war with the kingdom of great britain the colonists were reluctant to establish another powerful national government jealously guarding their new independence the continental congress created a loosely structured unicameral legislature that protected the liberty of the individual states at the expense of the confederation while calling on congress to regulate military and monetary affairs for example the articles of confederation provided no mechanism to ensure states complied with requests for troops or revenue at times this left the military in a precarious position as george washington wrote in a one seven eight one letter to the governor of massachusetts john hancock the end of the war the treaty of paris one seven eight three ending hostilities with great britain languished in congress for months because state representatives failed to attend sessions of the national legislature yet congress had no power to enforce attendance writing to george clinton in september one seven eight three george washington complained congress have come to no determination yet respecting the peace establishment nor am i able to say when they will i have lately had a conference with a committee on this subject and have reiterated my former opinions but it appears to me that there is not a sufficient representation to discuss great national points function the articles supported the congressional direction of the continental army and allowed the thirteen colonies to present a unified front when dealing with the european powers but as an instrument of government they were largely a failure congress could make decisions but had no power to enforce them perhaps the most important power that congress was denied was the power of taxation congress could only request money from the states understandably the states did not generally comply with the requests in full leaving the confederation chronically short of funds the states and the national congress had both incurred debts during the war and paying congressional debts became a major issue nevertheless the continental congress did take two actions with lasting impact the land ordinance of one seven eight five established the general land survey and ownership provisions used throughout later american expansion the northwest ordinance of one seven eight seven noted the agreement of the original states to give up western land claims and cleared the way for the entry of new states once the unity demanded by the revolutionary war became unnecessary the continental army was largely disbanded a very small national force was maintained to man frontier forts and protect against indian attacks meanwhile each of the states had an army or militia and one one of them had navies the wartime promises of bounties and land grants to be paid for service were not being met in one seven eight three washington defused the newburgh conspiracy but riots by unpaid pennsylvania veterans forced the congress to leave philadelphia on june two one revision in may one seven eight six charles pinckney of south carolina proposed that congress revise the articles of confederation recommended changes included granting congress power over foreign and domestic commerce and providing means for congress to collect money from state treasuries unanimous approval was necessary to make the alterations however and congress failed to reach a consensus in september five states assembled in the annapolis convention one seven eight six to discuss adjustments that would improve commerce under their chairman alexander hamilton they invited state representatives to convene in philadelphia to discuss improvements to the federal government after debate congress endorsed the plan to revise the articles of confederation on february two one one seven eight seven according to some historians the articles were flawed in particular the confederal government was unable to settle state disputes on issues like trade and had no power to tax directly after all the states were thirteen individual republics it took radical action to strip them of that sovereignty lessons although ultimately replaced by the united states constitution the articles of confederation provided stability during the american revolutionary war years most importantly the experience of drafting and living under this initial document provided valuable lessons in self governance and somewhat tempered fears about a powerful central government still reconciling the turmoil between state and federal authority continues to challenge america as seen in such conflicts as the one eight three two nullification crisis the american civil war one eight six one six five post civil war reconstruction and the supreme court s landmark brown v board of education decision in one nine five four signatures the copy of the articles in the u s national archives has a series of signatures on page six a list of them is presented here the signing of the articles was a process that has caused some confusion the articles were approved for distribution to the states on november one five one seven seven seven a copy was made for each state and one was kept by the congress the copies sent to the states for ratification were unsigned and a cover letter had only the signatures of henry laurens and charles thomson who were the president and secretary to the congress but the articles at that time were unsigned and the date was blank congress began the signing process by examining their copy of the articles on june two seven one seven seven eight they ordered a final copy prepared the one in the national archives and that delegates should inform the secretary of their authority for ratification then on july nine one seven seven eight the prepared copy was ready they dated it and began to sign they also requested each of the remaining states to notify its delegation when ratification was completed on that date delegates present from new hampshire massachusetts rhode island connecticut new york pennsylvania virginia and south carolina signed the articles to indicate that their states had ratified new jersey delaware and maryland could not since their states had not ratified north carolina and georgia also didn t sign that day since their delegations were absent after the first signing some delegates signed at the next meeting they attended for example john wentworth of new hampshire added his name on august eight john penn was the first of north carolina s delegates to arrive on july one zero and the delegation signed the articles on july two one one seven seven eight the other states had to wait until they ratified the articles and notified their congressional delegation georgia signed on july two four new jersey on november two six and delaware on february one two one seven seven nine after a wait of two years maryland ratified and her delegates signed the articles on march one one seven eight one the articles were finally in force congress had debated the articles for over a year and a half and the ratification process had taken nearly three and a half years many participants in the original debates were no longer delegates and some of the signers had only recently arrived the articles of confederation and perpetual union were signed by a group of men who were never present in the congress at the same time the signers and the states they represented were new hampshire

in law adam sedgwick adam sedgwick march two two one seven eight five january two seven one eight seven three was one of the founders of modern geology he proposed the devonian period of the geological timescale and later the cambrian period the latter proposal was based on work which he did on welsh rock strata sedgwick was born in dent at that time in yorkshire the third child of an anglican vicar he was educated at sedbergh school and trinity college cambridge introduction in one eight one seven he took holy orders and in one eight one eight he became woodwardian professor of geology at the university of cambridge department of earth sciences holding a chair that had been endowed ninety years before by the natural historian john woodward he lacked formal training in geology but he quickly became an active researcher in geology and paleontology during his tenure he immensely enlarged the geological collections of cambridge university and carried out important field research all over great britain sedgwick is said to have remarked upon being appointed woodwardian professor hitherto i have never turned a stone henceforth i will leave no stone unturned in one eight two two he carried out fieldwork unraveling the complex geology of the lake district of northern england armed with the new discoveries and techniques of william smith he met and befriended the poet william wordsworth on this expedition and also met the poet robert southey and the chemist john dalton his lectures at cambridge were immensely popular he was a spellbinding lecturer and breaking with the traditions of his time his lectures were open to women whom sedgwick thought could make great contributions to natural history he continued to rise in his profession in one eight two nine he became president of the geological society of london and in one eight four five a vice master of trinity college as vice master he led campaigns to open cambridge to non anglicans and to reorganize the academic programs in the process meeting and becoming close to queen victoria and her consort prince albert by the one eight five zero s he was in poor health cared for by his niece isabella still he kept giving his famous lectures until one eight seven one early work sedgwick was one of several great figures in what has been called the heroic age of geology the time when the great geological time periods were defined and when much exploration and fundamental research was carried out sedgwick s work placed him at the epicenter of one of the most heated geological controversies of his day stemming from his work with the gentleman geologist roderick murchison they explored the geology of scotland in one eight two seven and in one eight three nine they jointly presented their researches on certain rocks in devon england which had a distinctive fossil assemblage that led them to propose a new division of the geological time scale the devonian in the early one eight three zero s both men were working on the rocks of wales which were and are very difficult to work on due to extensive folding and faulting however they seemed to be older than most of the sedimentary rocks farther east murchison documented the presence of a distinctive set of fossils one in which very few fish were found but that included numerous different types of trilobites brachiopods and other such fossils murchison named the system of rocks containing such fossils the silurian after the silures a celtic tribe living in the welsh borderlands at the time of the romans sedgwick who had been working in central wales proposed the existence of a separate system below the silurian which he named the cambrian after cambria the latin name for wales the two presented a joint paper in one eight three five entitled on the silurian and cambrian systems exhibiting the order in which the older sedimentary strata succeed each other in england and wales sedgwick s upper cambrian overlapped with the lower part of murchison s silurian sedgwick had defined his cambrian using physical characters of the rocks which were unique to wales and had not relied extensively on fossils which could be found everywhere murchison who had used fossils extensively in defining the silurian claimed at first that the upper cambrian and then the entire cambrian were really parts of the silurian the resulting quarrel between the two men left them permanently estranged and took years to resolve there was more than a simple matter of names involved both geologists wanted the honour of describing the rocks that recorded the beginning of life on earth for no fossils were known that were older than those of the cambrian murchison felt that the fossils of sedgwick s cambrian were not different enough from his silurian forms to merit the naming of a geologic time period and it was some time before truly distinctive cambrian fossils were documented today following the solution worked out in one eight seven nine by sedgwick s colleague charles lapworth geologists use both time periods with a third one the ordovician also named for a celtic tribe in wales between the cambrian and the silurian equivalent to the disputed upper cambrian lower silurian beds each one of these is now known to be characterized by distinct fossil assemblages disagreement with darwin for one summer of his work in wales which was to lead to this controversy sedgwick made a fateful choice of field assistant a young cambridge graduate named charles darwin darwin had passed his examinations for the bachelor of arts degree in january one eight three one and began attending sedgwick s geology lectures which he found fascinating that summer the two men explored the rocks of north wales darwin got a crash course in field geology from sedgwick an experience that would stand him in good stead over the next five years on the round the world voyage of hms beagle during this voyage darwin sent rocks and fossils from south america back to sedgwick as well as descriptions of the geology of south america these impressed sedgwick who wrote in a letter to darwin s family he is doing admirably in s america he was inducted into the society shortly after his return the two stayed friends until sedgwick s death but sedgwick was upset and disappointed by darwin s theory of evolution by natural selection after reading the origin of species sedgwick candidly wrote to darwin on november two four one eight five nine if i did not think you a good tempered parts i laughed at till my sides were almost sore other parts i read with absolute sorrow because i think them utterly false however despite this difference of opinion the two men remained friendly until sedgwick s death flawed opinions sedgwick s own geological views were generally catastrophic he believed that the history of the earth had been marked by a series of cataclysmic events which had destroyed much of the earth s life in this belief he followed cuvier and he was opposed to charles lyell s models of slow gradual geological change and a more or less steady state earth however sedgwick was interested in the possibility that at least some of the catastrophic changes implied by the rock record might be shown to be gradual he originally followed his colleague william buckland in believing that the uppermost pleistocene deposits had been laid down by the biblical flood but retracted this belief after many of these deposits turned out to have been formed by glaciers not floods sedgwick also did not object to evolution or development as such theories were called then in the broad sense to the fact that the life on earth had changed over time nor was he a young earth creationist he believed that the earth must be extremely old as darwin wrote of sedgwick s lectures what a capital hand is sedgewick sic for drawing large cheques upon the bank of time however sedgwick believed in the divine creation of life over long periods of time by a power i cannot imitate or comprehend but in which i believe by a legitimate conclusion of sound reason drawn from the laws of harmonies of nature what sedgwick objected to was the apparent amoral and materialist nature of darwin s proposed mechanism natural selection which he thought degrading to humanity s spiritual aspirations his letter of november two four went on to state this view of nature you have stated admirably tho admitted by all naturalists but how came it about here in language if i do not mistake your meaning you have done your best in one or two pregnant cases to break it were it possible which thank god it is not to break it humanity in my mind would suffer a damage that might brutalize it sink the human race into a lower grade of degradation than any into which it has fallen since its written records tell us of its history external links sedgwick museum cambridge sedgwick club cambridge university of cambridge department of

polymath who became a naturalized british subject he wrote journalism novels social philosophy and books on scientific subjects he was a communist during much of the one nine three zero s and remained politically active until the one nine five zero s he wrote a number of popular books including arrow in the blue the first volume of his autobiography the yogi and the commissar a collection of essays many dealing with communism the sleepwalkers a history of man s changing vision of the universe the act of creation and the thirteenth tribe giving a new theory of the origins of the jews of eastern europe his most famous work the novel darkness at noon about the soviet purges of the one nine three zero s ranks with george orwell s nineteen eighty four as a fictional treatment of stalinism he also wrote encyclop dia britannica articles life he was born k sztler artur hungarians put the surname first in budapest hungary to a german speaking hungarian family of ashkenazi jewish descent his father henrik was an industrialist and inventor whose business ideas revealed flawed judgement for example he invested for a while in the manufacture of a kind of radioactive soap when artur was one four his family moved to vienna austria in one nine one eight hungary obtained its independence from austria and flirted for a while with bolshevism koestler studied science and psychology at the university of vienna where he became involved in zionism after completing his studies he worked as a news correspondent from one nine two six to one nine two nine he lived in the british mandate of palestine partly in a kibbutz he joined the german communist party in one nine three one but left it after the stalinist purges of one nine three eight during this period he traveled extensively in the soviet union and climbed mount ararat in turkey in turkmenistan he met the black american writer langston hughes in one nine three one he was a member of a zeppelin expedition to the north pole in his memoir the invisible writing koestler recalls that during the summer of one nine three five he wrote about half of a satirical novel called the good soldier schweik goes to war again it had been commissioned by willy m nzenberg the comintern s chief propagandist in the west but was vetoed by the party on the grounds of the book s pacifist errors p two eight three soon after the outbreak of world war ii the french authorities detained him for several months in a camp for resident aliens at le vernet in the foothills of the pyrenees mountains upon his release he joined the french foreign legion he eventually escaped to england via morocco and portugal in england he served in the british army as a member of the british pioneer corps one nine four one four two then worked for the bbc he became a british subject in one nine four five he returned to france after the war where he rubbed shoulders with the set gravitating around jean paul sartre and simone de beauvoir one of the characters in de beauvoir s novel the mandarins is believed based on koestler he returned to london and spent the rest of his life writing and lecturing he was made a cbe in the one nine seven zero s in one nine eight three koestler suffering from parkinson s disease and leukemia committed joint suicide by taking an overdose of drugs with his third wife cynthia he had long been an advocate of voluntary euthanasia and in one nine eight one had become vice president of exit a british group campaigning for it his will endowed the chair of parapsychology at the university of edinburgh in scotland multilingualism in addition to his mother tongue german koestler became fluent in hungarian english and french and knew some hebrew and russian his biographer david cesarani claims there is some evidence that koestler may have picked up some yiddish from his grandfather koestler s multilingualism was principally due to his having resided worked and or studied in hungary austria germany palestine pre independence israel the soviet union the united kingdom and france all by four zero years of age though he wrote the bulk of his later work in english koestler wrote his best known novels in three different languages the gladiators in hungarian darkness at noon in german although the original is now lost and arrival and departure in english his journalism was written in german hebrew french and english he claimed to have produced the first hebrew language crossword puzzles women koestler was married to dorothy asher one nine three five five zero mamaine paget one nine five zero five two and cynthia jefferies one nine six five eight three he also had a very short fling with the french writer simone de beauvoir one that may explain the mutual animosity between him and jean paul sartre david cesarani claimed that koestler beat and raped several women including film director jill craigie the resulting protests led to the removal of a bust of koestler from public display at the university of edinburgh questions have also been raised by his suicide pact with his last spouse although he was terminally ill at the time she was apparently healthy leading some to claim he wrongly persuaded her to take her own life mixed legacy just as darkness at noon was selling well during the cold war of the four zero s and five zero s koestler announced his retirement from politics much of what he wrote thereafter revealed a multidisciplinary thinker whose work anticipated a number of trends by many years he was among the first to experiment with lsd in a laboratory he also wrote about japanese and indian mysticism in the lotus and the robot one nine six zero he did not merely arrive at different answers to accepted questions rather he tended to ask questions that no one else thought to ask this originality resulted in an uneven set of ideas and conclusions some of them such as his work on creativity insight and outlook act of creation and the history of science the sleepwalkers are arguably brilliant and challenge us to readjust our thinking some of his other pursuits such as his interest in the paranormal his support for euthanasia his theory of the origin of ashkenazi jews like himself and his disagreement with darwinism are more controversial politics koestler was involved in a number of political causes during his life from zionism and communism to anti communism voluntary euthanasia and campaigns against capital punishment particularly hanging he was also an early advocate of nuclear disarmament journalism until the bestseller status of darkness at noon made him financially comfortable koestler often earned his living as a journalist and foreign correspondent trading on his ability to write quickly in several languages and to acquire with facility a working knowledge of a new language he wrote for a variety of newspapers including vossische zeitung science editor and b z am mittag foreign editor in the one nine two zero s in the early one nine three zero s he worked for the ullstein publishing group in berlin and did freelance writing for the french press while covering the spanish civil war in one nine three seven he was captured and held for several months by the falangists in m laga until the british foreign office negotiated his release his spanish testament records these experiences which he soon transformed into his classic prison novel darkness at noon after his release from spanish detention koestler worked for the news chronicle then edited die zukunft with willi m nzenberg an anti nazi anti stalinist german language paper based in paris founded in one nine three eight during and after wwii he wrote for a number of english and american papers including the sunday telegraph on various subjects science during the last three zero years of his life koestler wrote extensively on science and scientific practice the post modernist scepticism colouring much of this writing tended to alienate most of the scientific community a case in point is his one nine seven one book the case of the midwife toad about the biologist paul kammerer who claimed to find experimental support for lamarckian inheritance mysticism and a fascination with the paranormal imbued much of his later work and greatly influenced his personal life he left a substantial part of his estate to establish the koestler institute at the university of edinburgh dedicated to the study of paranormal phenomena his the roots of coincidence centered on yet another line of unconventional research by paul kammerer this time his claim of a quantum theory of coincidence or synchronicity a theory koestler evaluated in light of the writings of carl jung more controversial were koestler s studies of levitation and telepathy judaism although a lifelong atheist koestler s ancestry was jewish his biographer david cesarani has claimed that koestler deliberately disowned his jewish ancestry koestler s book the thirteenth tribe advanced the controversial thesis that ashkenazi jews are not descended from the israelites of antiquity but from the khazars a turkic people in the caucasus who converted to judaism in the eight th century and were later forced to move westwards into current russia ukraine and poland koestler stated that part of his intent in writing the thirteenth tribe was to defuse anti semitism by undermining the identification of european jews with biblical jews with the hope of rendering anti semitic epithets such as christ killer inapplicable ironically koestler s thesis that ashkenazi jews are not semitic has become an important claim of many anti semitic groups some palestinians have eagerly seized upon this thesis believing that to identify most jews as non semites seriously undermines their historical claim to the land of israel the thesis of the thirteenth tribe has since been criticized to date the genetic evidence has been inconclusive some researchers claim to find a middle eastern genetic element in virtually all ashkenazim others note both turkic words and turkic genetic markers in these populations but the usefulness of genetic markers in determining ancestry can be problematic for instance ashkenazim also display a high level of similarity to the genetic markers of khoisan bushmen in southern africa a thorough review of the scientific literature can be found at khazaria com when koestler resided in palestine during the one nine two zero s he lived on a kibbutz an experience forming the basis of his unfinished thieves in the night his view of israel was that it would never be destroyed short of a second shoah he supported the statehood of israel but opposed a diaspora jewish culture in an interview published in the london jewish chronicle around the time of israel s founding koestler asserted that all jews should either migrate to israel or assimilate completely into their local cultures koestler was also no dogmatic zionist for instance he proposed that israel drop the hebrew alphabet for the roman cultural influence in his younger days the singer sting was an avid reader of koestler his band of the time the police were to name one of their albums ghost in the machine after one of koestler s books the title synchronicity was also inspired by koestler s the roots of coincidence which mentions carl jung s theory of the same name koestler knew little about the burgeoning new wave music scene and is alleged to have said look at this did you ever see a magazine called the new musical express it turns out there is a pop group called the police i don t know why they are called that presumably to distinguish them from the punks and they ve made an album of my essay the ghost in the machine i didn t know anything about it until my clipping agency sent me a review of the record the cyberpunk manga and anime series ghost in the shell was also inspired by koestler s the ghost in the machine bibliography an excellent

largest ocean covering approximately one fifth of its surface the ocean s name derived from greek mythology means the sea of atlas this ocean occupies an elongated s shaped basin extending in a north south direction and is divided into the north atlantic and south atlantic by equatorial counter currents at about eight north latitude bounded by the americas on the west and europe and africa on the east the atlantic is linked to the pacific ocean by the arctic ocean on the north and the drake passage on the south an artificial connection between the atlantic and pacific is also provided by the panama canal on the east the dividing line between the atlantic and the indian ocean is the two zero east meridian running south from cape agulhas to antarctica the atlantic is separated from the arctic ocean by a line from greenland to northwestern iceland and then from northeastern iceland to southernmost tip of spitsbergen and then to north cape in northern norway the atlantic ocean as seen from the west coast of ireland on a fair day covering approximately two zero of earth s surface the atlantic ocean is second only to the pacific in size with its adjacent seas it occupies an area of

bottom the principal feature of the bottom topography of the atlantic ocean is a great submarine mountain range called the mid atlantic ridge it extends from iceland in the north to approximately five eight south latitude reaching a maximum width of about one six zero zero kilometres one zero zero zero mi a great rift valley also extends along the ridge over most of its length the depth of water over the ridge is less than two seven zero zero metres eight nine zero zero ft in most places and several mountain peaks rise above the water forming islands the south atlantic ocean has an additional submarine ridge the walvis ridge the mid atlantic ridge separates the atlantic ocean into two large troughs with depths averaging between three seven zero zero and five five zero zero metres one two zero zero zero and one eight zero zero zero ft transverse ridges running between the continents and the mid atlantic ridge divide the ocean floor into numerous basins some of the larger basins are the guiana north american cape verde and canaries basins in the north atlantic the largest south atlantic basins are the angola cape argentina and brazil basins the deep ocean floor is thought to be fairly flat although numerous seamounts and some guyots exist several deeps or trenches are also found on the ocean floor the puerto rico trench in the north atlantic is the deepest the laurentian abyss is found off the eastern coast of canada in the south atlantic the south sandwich trench reaches a depth of eight four two eight metres two seven six five one ft a third major trench the romanche trench is located near the equator and reaches a depth of about seven four five four metres two four four five five ft the shelves along the margins of the continents constitute about one one of the bottom topography in addition a number of deep channels cut across the continental rise ocean sediments are composed of terrigenous pelagic and authigenic material terrigenous deposits consist of sand mud and rock particles formed by erosion weathering and volcanic activity on land and then washed to sea these materials are largely found on the continental shelves and are thickest off the mouths of large rivers or off desert coasts pelagic deposits which contain the remains of organisms that sink to the ocean floor include red clays and globigerina pteropod and siliceous oozes covering most of the ocean floor and ranging in thickness from six zero metres to three three zero zero metres two zero zero ft to one one zero zero zero ft they are thickest in the convergence belts and in the zones of upwelling authigenic deposits consist of such materials as manganese nodules they occur where sedimentation proceeds slowly or where currents sort the deposits water characteristics the salinity of the surface waters in the open ocean ranges from three three to three seven parts per thousand by mass and varies with latitude and season although the minimum salinity values are found just north of the equator in general the lowest values are in the high latitudes and along coasts where large rivers flow into the ocean maximum salinity values occur at about two five north latitude surface salinity values are influenced by evaporation precipitation river inflow and melting of sea ice surface water temperatures which vary with latitude current systems and season and reflect the latitudinal distribution of solar energy range from less than two c to two nine c two eight f to eight four f maximum temperatures occur north of the equator and minimum values are found in the polar regions in the middle latitudes the area of maximum temperature variations values may vary by seven c to eight c one three f to one five f the atlantic ocean consists of four major water masses the north and south atlantic central waters constitute the surface waters the sub antarctic intermediate water extends to depths of one zero zero zero metres three three zero zero ft the north atlantic deep water reaches depths of as much as four zero zero zero metres one three two zero zero ft the antarctic bottom water occupies ocean basins at depths greater than four zero zero zero metres one three two zero zero ft within the north atlantic ocean currents isolate a large elongated body of water known as the sargasso sea in which the salinity is noticeably higher than average the sargasso sea contains large amounts of seaweed and is also the spawning ground for the european eel due to the coriolis effect water in the north atlantic circulates in a clockwise direction whereas water circulation in the south atlantic is counter clockwise the south tides in the atlantic ocean are semi diurnal that is two high tides occur during each two four lunar hours the tides are a general wave that moves from south to north in latitudes above four zero north some east west oscillation occurs climate waves in the trade winds in the atlantic ocean areas of converging winds that move along the same track as the prevailing wind create instabilities in the atmosphere that may lead to the formation of hurricanes the climate of the atlantic ocean and adjacent land areas is influenced by the temperatures of the surface waters and water currents as well as the winds blowing across the waters because of the oceans great capacity for retaining heat maritime climates are moderate and free of extreme seasonal variations precipitation can be approximated from coastal weather data and air temperature from the water temperatures the oceans are the major source of the atmospheric moisture that is obtained through evaporation climatic zones vary with latitude the warmest climatic zones stretch across the atlantic north of the equator the coldest zones are in the high latitudes with the coldest regions corresponding to the areas covered by sea ice ocean currents contribute to climatic control by transporting warm and cold waters to other regions adjacent land areas are affected by the winds that are cooled or warmed when blowing over these currents the gulf stream for example warms the atmosphere of the british isles and northwestern europe and the cold water currents contribute to heavy fog off the coast of northeastern canada the grand banks area and the northwestern coast of africa in general winds tend to transport moisture and warm or cool air over land areas hurricanes develop in the southern part of the north atlantic ocean history and economy the atlantic ocean appears to be the second youngest of the world s oceans after the southern ocean evidence indicates that it did not exist prior to one eight zero million years ago when the continents that formed from the breakup of the ancestral supercontinent pangaea were being rafted apart by the process of seafloor spreading the atlantic has been extensively explored since the earliest settlements were established along its shores the vikings portuguese and christopher columbus were the most famous among its early explorers after columbus european exploration rapidly accelerated and many new trade routes were established as a result the atlantic became and remains the major artery between europe and the americas known as transatlantic trade numerous scientific explorations have been undertaken including those by the german meteor expedition columbia university s lamont geological observatory and the united states navy hydrographic office the ocean has also contributed significantly to the development and economy of the countries around it besides its major transatlantic transportation and communication routes the atlantic offers abundant petroleum deposits in the sedimentary rocks of the continental shelves and the world s richest fishing resources especially in the waters covering the shelves the major species of fish caught are cod haddock hake herring and mackerel the most productive areas include the grand banks of newfoundland the shelf area off nova scotia georges bank off cape cod the bahama banks the waters around iceland the irish sea the dogger bank of the north sea and the falkland banks eel lobster and whales have also been taken in great quantities all these factors taken together tremendously enhance the atlantic s great commercial value because of the threats to the ocean environment presented by oil spills marine debris and the incineration of toxic wastes at sea various international treaties exist to reduce some forms of pollution in one eight five eight the first transatlantic telegraph cable was laid by cyrus field in

atlantic ocean oceans arthur schopenhauer february two two one seven eight eight september two one one eight six zero was a german philosopher he is most famous for his work the world as will and representation he is commonly known for having espoused a sort of philosophical pessimism that saw life as being essentially evil futile and full of suffering however upon closer inspection in accordance with eastern thought especially that of hinduism and buddhism he saw salvation deliverance or escape from suffering in aesthetic contemplation sympathy for others and ascetic living his ideas profoundly influenced the fields of philosophy psychology music and literature life schopenhauer was born in one seven eight eight in sztutowo poland near gda sk he was the son of heinrich floris schopenhauer and johanna schopenhauer a middle class mercantile family of dutch heritage although they had strong feelings against any kind of nationalism indeed the name arthur was selected by his father especially because it was the same in english german and french his parents were both from the city and johanna was an author as well after the city was annexed by prussia during the second partition of poland in one seven nine three the schopenhauer family fled to hamburg in one eight zero five schopenhauer s father died possibly by suicide and johanna moved to weimar because of a promise to pursue a business career schopenhauer remained in hamburg his disgust of this career however drove him away to join his mother in weimar after only a year he never got along with his mother when the writer goethe who was a friend of johanna schopenhauer told her that he thought her son was destined for great things johanna objected she had never heard there could be two geniuses in a single family schopenhauer studied at the university of g ttingen and was awarded a phd from the university of jena in one eight two zero schopenhauer became a lecturer at the university of berlin it was there that his opposition to hegel began while in berlin schopenhauer became involved in a consuming lawsuit from a caroline marquet she asked for damages from him a man of independent means on the basis that she had been injured when schopenhauer allegedly pushed her marquet had noisily attracted schopenhauer s attention then marquet s companion witnessed her as being prostrate outside of his apartment marquet claimed that the philosopher had assaulted and battered her after she refused to leave his doorway in this manner she succeeded in gaining through the court a portion of schopenhauer s limited wealth he had to make payments for many years his reputation was permanently damaged by her legal machination schopenhauer s health deteriorated during the year of one eight six zero he died of natural causes on september two one of the same year at the age of seven two schopenhauer called himself a kantian and despised hegel he formulated a pessimistic philosophy that gained importance and support after the failure of the german and austrian revolutions of one eight four eight philosophy schopenhauer s starting point was kant s division of the universe into phenomenon and noumenon claiming that the noumenon was the same as that in us which we call will it is the inner content and the driving force of the world for schopenhauer human will had ontological primacy over the intellect in other words desire is understood to be prior to thought and in a parallel sense will is said to be prior to being in solving alleviating the fundamental problems of life schopenhauer was rare among philosophers in considering philosophy and logic less important or less effective than art certain types of charitable practice loving kindness in his terms and certain forms of religious discipline schopenhauer concluded that discursive thought such as philosophy and logic could neither touch nor transcend the nature of desire i e the will in the world as will and representation schopenhauer posited that humans living in the realm of objects are living in the realm of desire and thus are eternally tormented by that desire his idea of the role of desire in life is similar to that of vedanta hinduism and buddhism and schopenhauer draws attention to these similarities himself while schopenhauer s philosophy may sound rather mystical in such a summary his methodology was resolutely empirical rather than speculative or transcendental schopenhauer s identification of the kantian noumenon i e the actually existing entity with what we call our will deserves some explanation the noumenon was what kant called the ding an sich the thing in itself the reality that is the foundation of our sensory and mental representations of an external world in kantian terms those sensory and mental representations are mere phenomena schopenhauer s assertion that what we call our will is the same as this noumenon might at first instance strike some as oddly as heraclitus s revelation that everything is made out of fire but kant s philosophy was formulated as a response to the radical philosophical skepticism of david hume and his fellow british empiricists who claimed that as far as we could tell there was no outside reality beyond our mental representations of it schopenhauer begins by arguing that kant s demarcation between external objects knowable only as phenomena and the thing in itself of noumenon contains a significant omission there is in fact one physical object we know more intimately than we know any object of sense perception it is our own body we know our human bodies have boundaries and occupy space the same way other objects known only through our named senses do though we seldom think of our bodies as physical objects we know even before reflection that it shares some of their properties we understand that a watermelon cannot successfully occupy the same space as an oncoming truck we know that if we tried to repeat the experiment with our own bodies we would obtain similar results we know this even if we do not understand the physics involved we know that our consciousness inhabits a physical body similar to other physical objects only known as phenomena yet our consciousness is not commensurate with our body most of us possess the power of voluntary motion we usually are not aware of our lungs breath or our heartbeat unless our attention is called to it our ability to control either is limited our kidneys command our attention on their schedule rather than one we choose few of us have any idea what our livers are doing right now though this organ is as needful as lungs heart or kidneys the conscious mind is the servant not the master of these and other organs these organs have an agenda which the conscious mind did not choose and has limited power over when schopenhauer identifies the noumenon with the desires needs and impulses in us that we name will what he is saying is that we participate in the reality of an otherwise unachievable world outside the mind through will we cannot prove that our mental picture of an outside world corresponds with a reality by reasoning through will we know without thinking that the world can stimulate us we suffer fear or desire these states arise involuntarily they arise prior to reflection they arise even when the conscious mind would prefer to hold them at bay the rational mind is for schopenhauer a leaf borne along in a stream of pre reflective and largely unconscious emotion that stream is will and through will if not through logic we can participate in the underlying reality that lies beyond mere phenomena it is for this reason that schopenhauer identifies the noumenon with what we call our will also schopenhauer s philosophy could be considered as panpsychism and solipsism and in some way gnostic psychology schopenhauer was perhaps even more influential in his treatment of man s mind than he was in the realm of philosophy philosophers have not traditionally been impressed by the tribulations of love but schopenhauer addressed it and related concepts forthrightly we should be surprised that a matter that generally plays such an important part in the life of man love has hitherto been almost entirely disregarded by philosophers and lies before us as raw and untreated material he gave a name to a force within man which he felt invariably had precedence over reason the will to live wille zum leben defined as an inherent drive within human beings and indeed all creatures to stay alive and to reproduce schopenhauer refused to conceive of love as either trifling or accidental but rather understood it to be an immensely powerful force lying unseen within man s psyche and dramatically shaping the world the ultimate aim of all love affairs is more important than all other aims in man s life and therefore it is quite worthy of the profound seriousness with which everyone pursues it what is decided by it is nothing less than the composition of the next generation these ideas foreshadowed and laid the groundwork for darwin s theory of evolution nietzsche s will to power and freud s concepts of the libido and the unconscious mind aesthetics see main article schopenhauer s aesthetics this wild and powerful drive to reproduce however caused suffering and pain in the world for schopenhauer one way to escape the suffering inherent in a world of will was through art through art schopenhauer thought the thinking subject could be jarred out of their limited individual perspective to feel a sense of the universal metaphysics directly the universal in question of course was the will the contest of personal desire with a world that was by nature inimical to its satisfaction is inevitably tragical therefore the highest place in art was given to tragedy music was also given a special status in schopenhauer s aesthetics as it did not rely upon the medium of representation to communicate a sense of the universal schopenhauer believed the function of art to be a meditation on the unity of human nature and an attempt to either demonstrate or directly communicate to the audience a certain existential angst for which most forms of entertainment including bad art only provided a distraction a wide range of authors from thomas hardy to woody allen and artists have been influenced by this system of aesthetics and in the two zero th century this area of schopenhauer s work garnered more attention and praise than any other according to daniel albright two zero zero five schopenhauer thought that music was the only art that did not merely copy ideas but actually embodied the will itself politics schopenhauer s politics were for the most part a much diminished echo of his system of ethics the latter being expressed in die beiden grundprobleme der ethik available in english as two separate books on the basis of morality and on the freedom of the will ethics also occupies about one fourth of his central work the world as will and representation in occasional political comments in his parerga and paralimpomena and manuscript remains schopenhauer described himself as a proponent of limited government what was essential he thought was that the state should leave each man free to work out his own salvation and so long as government was thus limited he would prefer to be ruled by a lion than one of his fellow rats i e a monarch schopenhauer did however share the view of thomas hobbes on the necessity of the state and of state violence to check the destructive tendencies innate to our species schopenhauer by his own admission did not give much thought to politics and several times he writes prideful boasts of how little attention he had paid to political affairs of his day in a life that spanned several revolutions in french and german government and a few continent shaking wars he did indeed maintain his aloof position of minding not the times but the eternities schopenhauer on women schopenhauer is also famous for his essay on women ber die weiber in which he expressed his opposition to what he called teutonico christian stupidity on female affairs he claimed that woman is by nature meant to obey and opposed schiller s poem in honor of women w rde der frauen the essay does give two compliments however that women are decidedly more sober in their judgment than men are and are more sympathetic to the suffering of others however the latter was discounted as weakness rather than humanitarian virtue the ultra intolerant view of women contrasts with schopenhauer s generally liberal views on other social issues he was strongly against taboos on issues like suicide and masochism and condemned the treatment of african slaves this polemic on female nature has since been fiercely attacked as misogynistic however he did not hold a universally negative opinion of women in particular one should note that schopenhauer had a very high opinion of madame de guyon whose writings and biography he highly recommended in any case the controversial writing has influenced many from nietzsche to one nine th century feminists while schopenhauer s hostility to women may tell us more about his biography than about philosophy his biological analysis of the difference between the sexes and their separate roles in the struggle for survival and reproduction anticipates some of the claims that were later ventured by sociobiologists and evolutionary psychologists in the twentieth century schopenhauer on homosexuality schopenhauer was also one of the first philosophers since the days of greek philosophy to address the subject of male homosexuality in the third expanded edition of the world as will and representation one eight five six schopenhauer added an appendix to his chapter on the metaphysics of sexual love in it he develops the idea that since only mature men and fully adult but pre menopausal women are capable of bearing healthy children in early adolescence and in late middle age the sexual appetite is susceptible of being turned towards another channel while there may again be more autobiography than analysis in this hypothesis it is consistent with the general tenor of schopenhauer s thought which gives the will in nature the position of setting an agenda for individual lives it is also one of the first attempts at portraying homosexuality as a natural phenomenon acknowledging its existence in every culture and seeking to explain its appearance even in those cultures whose moralities sharply condemn homosexual behaviour schopenhauer on hegel schopenhauer seems to have disliked just about everything concerning his contemporary georg wilhelm friedrich hegel the following quotation from on the basis of morality page one five one six is quite famous but schopenhauer had good reason to mistrust the writings of hegel in his foreword to the first edition of his work die beiden grundprobleme der ethik schopenhauer had found hegel to have fallen prey to the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy schopenhauer s critique of hegel is most certainly directed at his perception that hegel s works use deliberately impressive but ultimately vacuous jargon and neologisms and that they contained castles of abstraction that sounded impressive but ultimately contained no verifiable content he also thought that his glorification of church and state were designed for personal advantage and had little to do with search for philosophical truth although schopenhauer may have appeared vain in his constant attacks on hegel they were not necessarily devoid of merit the right hegelians interpreted hegel as seeing the prussian state of his day as perfect and the goal of all history up until then common misconceptions many are put off schopenhauer by descriptions of him as an obstinate and arrogant man who did not lead the ascetic life that he glorified in his work the idea that he made resignation into a command to virtue is inaccurate as he was merely trying to explain asceticism in terms of metaphysics he does refer to the asceticism as a state of inner peace and cheerfulness but he also clearly states that he was not trying to recommend the denial of the will above the affirmation of the will furthermore the call to asceticism was supposed to come to select individuals as knowledge all of a sudden rather than being a virtue that can be taught in general he wrote it is a strange demand on a moralist that he should commend no other virtue than that which he himself possesses the world as will and representation vol i six eight nietzsche seems to have made this misinterpretation leading some people to a distorted view of schopenhauer the following sentence from the twilight of the idols is often quoted schopenhauer did see all these things as means to a more peaceful and enlightened way of life but none of them were denial of the will to live only asceticism is referred to in that way nietzsche also claimed that schopenhauer did not recognise that suffering had a redemptive quality yet his recognition of this seems blatantly clear in part four of the world as will and representation also his identification of the will with the kantian thing in itself has been misunderstood kant defined things in themselves as being beyond comprehension and that no one could know the inner nature of a material thing it is sometimes thought that schopenhauer denied this but he did not what he did assert was that one could know things about the thing in itself for example you can know that the will is a striving force that it is endless that it causes suffering that it will produce boredom if unoccupied etc however he did not say that you could directly know

interior south and southeast and rain forest in the north and in cabinda the zambezi river and several tributaries of the congo river have their sources in angola the coastal strip is tempered by the cool benguela current resulting in a climate similar to coastal peru or baja california there is a short rainy season lasting from february to april summers are hot and dry while winters are mild the interior highlands have a mild climate with a rainy season from november through april followed by a cool dry season from may to october elevations generally range from three zero zero zero to six

has water sufficient to allow large ships to unload close inshore the coast plain extends inland for a distance varying from three zero to one zero zero miles four eight to one six five km this region is in general sparsely watered and somewhat sterile the approach to the great central plateau of africa is marked by a series of irregular terraces this intermediate mountain belt is covered with

to the zambezi system or like the okavango drain to lake ngami geology the rock formations of angola are met with in three distinct regions the littoral zone the median zone formed by a series of hills more or less parallel with the coast the central plateau the central plateau consists of ancient crystalline rocks with granites overlain by unfossiliferous sandstones and conglomerates of paleozoic age the outcrops are largely hidden under laterite the median zone is composed largely of crystalline rocks with granites and some palaeozoic unfossiliferous rocks the littoral zone contains the only fossiliferous strata these are of tertiary and cretaceous ages the latter rocks resting on a reddish sandstone of older date the cretaceous rocks of the dombe grande region near benguella are of albian age and belong to the acanthoceras mamillari zone the beds containing schloenbachia inflata are referable to the gault rocks of tertiary age are met with at dombe grande mossamedes and near loanda the sandstones with gypsum copper and sulfur of dombe are doubtfully considered to be of triassic age recent eruptive rocks mainly basalts form a line of hills almost bare of vegetation between benguella and mossamedes nepheline basalts and liparites occur at dombe grande the presence of gum copal in considerable quantities in the superficial rocks is characteristic of certain regions

winds which arc w s w and s s w two seasons are distinguished the cool from june to september and the rainy from october to may the heaviest rainfall occurs in april and is accompanied by violent storms terrain angola has three principal natural regions the coastal lowland characterized by low plains and terraces hills and mountains rising inland from the coast into a great escarpment and an area of high plains called the high plateau planalto which extends eastward from the escarpment the highest point in angola is morro de moco at two six two zero m coastal lowland the coastal lowland rises from the sea in a series of low terraces this region varies in width from about two five kilometers near benguela to more than one five zero kilometers in the cuanza river valley just south of angola s capital luanda and is markedly different from angola s highland mass the atlantic ocean s cold northwardflowing benguela current substantially reduces precipitation along the coast making the region relatively arid or nearly so south of benguela where it forms the northern extension of the namib desert and quite dry even in its northern reaches even where as around luanda the average annual rainfall may be as much as fifty centimeters it is not uncommon for the rains to fail given this pattern of precipitation the far south is marked by sand dunes which give way to dry scrub along the middle coast portions of the northern coastal plain are covered by thick brush hills and mountains the belt of hills and mountains parallels the coast at distances ranging from two zero kilometers to one zero zero kilometers inland the cuanza river divides the zone into two parts the northern part rises gradually from the coastal zone to an average elevation of five zero zero meters with crests as high as one zero zero zero meters to one eight zero zero meters south of the cuanza river the hills rise sharply from the coastal lowlands and form a high escarpment extending from a point east of luanda and running south through namibia the escarpment reaches two four zero zero meters at its highest point southeast of the town of sumbe and is steepest in the far south in the serra da chela mountain range high plateau the high plateau lies to the east of the hills and mountains and dominates angola s terrain the surface of the plateau is typically flat or rolling but parts of the benguela plateau and the humpata highland area of the hu la plateau in the south reach heights of two five zero zero meters and more the malanje plateau to the north rarely exceeds one zero zero zero meters in height the benguela plateau and the coastal area in the immediate environs of benguela and lobito the bi plateau the malanje plateau and a small section of the hu la plateau near the town of lubango have long been among the most densely settled areas in angola drainage most of the country s many rivers originate in central angola but their patterns of flow are diverse and their ultimate outlets varied a number of rivers flow in a more or less westerly course to the atlantic ocean providing water for irrigation in the dry coastal strip and the potential for hydroelectric power only some of which had been realized by one nine eight eight two of angola s most important rivers the cuanza and the cunene take a more indirect route to the atlantic the cuanza flowing north and the cunene flowing south before turning west the cuanza is the only river wholly within angola that is navigable for nearly two zero zero kilometers from its mouth by boats of commercially or militarily significant size the congo river whose mouth and western end form a small portion of angola s northern border with zaire is also navigable north of the lunda divide a number of important tributaries of the congo river flow north to join it draining angola s northeast quadrant south of the divide some rivers flow into the zambezi river and thence to the indian ocean others to the okavango river as the cubango river is called along the border with namibia and in botswana and thence to the okavango swamp in botswana the tributaries of the cubango river and several of the southern rivers flowing

down the line at about two three zero p m while leading one of those charges he was wounded taking a bullet behind his right knee he did not think the wound serious at the time and sent his personal physician to attend to some wounded union soldiers instead the bullet had in fact clipped his popliteal artery and his boot was filling up with blood within a few minutes johnston was observed by his staff to be nearly fainting off of his horse and asked him if he was wounded to which he replied yes and i fear seriously it is possible that johnston s duel in one eight three seven had caused nerve damage or numbness to that leg and that he did not feel the wound to his leg as a result johnston was taken to a small ravine where he bled to death in minutes ironically it is probable that a confederate soldier fired the fatal round no union soldiers were observed to have ever gotten behind johnston during the fatal charge while it is known that many confederates were firing at the union lines while johnston charged well in advance of his soldiers he was the highest ranking casualty of the war and his death was a strong blow to the morale of the confederacy jefferson davis considered

basin which is between four zero zero zero and four five zero zero m one three zero zero zero and one five zero zero zero ft deep and the north american or hyperborean basin which is about four zero zero zero m deep the topography of the ocean bottom is marked by fault block ridges plains of the abyssal zone ocean deeps and basins the average depth of the arctic ocean is one zero three eight m three four zero seven ft in part due to the large extent of continental shelf extant on the eurasian side the arctic ocean is used by both marine mammals and nuclear submarines the greatest inflow of water comes from the atlantic by way of the norwegian current which then flows along the eurasian coast water also enters from the pacific via the bering strait the east greenland current carries the major outflow temperature and salinity vary seasonally as the ice cover melts and freezes ice covers most of the ocean surface year round causing subfreezing temperatures much of the time the arctic is a major source of very cold air that inevitably moves toward the equator meeting with warmer air in the middle latitudes and causing rain and snow little marine life exists where the ocean surface is covered with ice throughout the year marine life abounds in open areas especially the more southerly waters the ocean s major ports are the russian cities of murmansk and arkhangelsk archangel the arctic ocean is important as the shortest air route between the pacific coast of north america and europe overflies it major chokepoint is the southern chukchi sea northern access to the pacific ocean

that resembles a human being usually both in appearance and behavior the word derives from the greek andr meaning man male and the suffix eides used to mean of the species alike from eidos species the word droid a robot in the star wars universe is derived from this meaning in the semantic sense the word android is a misnomer the intended meaning is an artificial human being like being while the literal translation is an artificial male being the word andros has definite meaning of male human being in greek while the word man can mean either male human being or human being in general the gender neutral word for human being in greek is anthropos and the correct word for an artificial human being like automaton would be anthropoid toc usage and distinctions unlike the terms robot a mechanical being and cyborg a being that is partly organic and partly mechanical the word android has been used in literature and other media to denote several different kinds of artificially constructed beings a robot that closely resembles a human a cyborg that closely resembles a human an artificially created yet primarily organic being that closely resembles a human although human morphology is not necessarily the ideal form for working robots the fascination in developing robots that can mimic it can be found historically in the assimilation of two concepts simulacra devices that exhibit likeness and automata devices that have independence the term android was first used by the french author mathias villiers de l isle adam one eight three eight one eight eight nine in his work tomorrow s eve featuring an artificial human like robot named hadaly as said by the officer in the story in this age of realien advancement who knows what goes on in the mind of those responsible for these mechanical dolls although karel apek s robots in r u r rossum s universal robots one nine two one the play that introduced the word robot to the world were organic artificial humans the word robot has come to primarily refer to mechanical humans animals and other beings the term android can mean either one of these while a cyborg cybernetic organism or bionic man would be a creature that is a combination of organic and mechanical parts ambiguity historically science fiction authors have used android in a greater diversity of ways than the terms robot and cyborg in some fiction works the primary difference between a robot and android is only skin deep with androids being made to look almost exactly like humans on the outside but with internal mechanics exactly the same as that of robots in other stories authors have defined android to indicate a wholly organic yet artificial creation other definitions of android fall somewhere in between the character data from the television series star trek the next generation is described as an android data became intoxicated in an early episode the naked now and is later referred to having bioplast sheeting for skin the most toys perhaps suggesting that he was initially intended by the writers to be at least partially organic otherwise data was shown to be mechanical throughout and this often became a central plot theme the replicants from the movie blade runner were bioengineered organic beings while they were not referred to as either robots or androids in the movie the screenplay was originally based on a novel by philip k dick called do androids dream of electric sheep in the video game beneath a steel sky genetically engineered androids similar to blade runner s replicants are a central plot theme however despite their organic makeup their behavior is programmed by computer the robots of apek s r u r were organic in nature today an author writing a similar story might very well be inclined to call them androids the character ash in the movie alien another artificial organic being is often referred to as an android though not in the dialogue of the movie itself similarly the character bishop in aliens and alien is a more advanced android commonly called a synthetic but prefers to be called an artificial person much later in the series timeline the character call in alien resurrection is ashamed of being an android c three po and r two d two from the star wars movies are referred to as droids while c three po could reasonably be called an android because he is humanoid in appearance the squat cylinder r two d two is only humanoid in behavior in the movie a i the robotic characters are called mechanoids but the film is loosely based on a short story written by brian aldiss called supertoys last all summer long in which the central character david is called an android by which aldiss seemed to be referring to an organic creation in the anime manga chobits androids are known as persicoms essentially computers in a man made body the series does not go into their internal composition but it is assumed to be artificial with a very realistic outside one of the key points of this series was a special type of persicom named a chobit a persicom that had free will and the ability to fall in love and have emotions androids in fiction thus far androids have remained mostly within the domain of science fiction and frequently in film and television however some humanoid robots exist one of the earliest android characters is otho from the captain future stories of edmond hamilton otho s construction is never discussed but he is much more human like than his companion grag a mechanical robot isaac asimov s robot stories are mostly about androids many are collected in i robot one nine five zero they promulgated a set of rules of ethics for androids and robots see three laws of robotics that greatly influenced other writers and thinkers in their treatment of the subject most of asimov s robots appear too artificial to be mistaken for human beings with the notable exceptions of r jander panell r daneel olivaw and andrew martin perhaps the most famous android is data played by actor brent spiner of the series star trek the next generation one nine eight seven one nine nine four and several spin off motion pictures this character was largely inspired by another android character created by gene roddenberry for the questor tapes data s immediate family brothers lore and b four et al daughter lal and mother dr juliana tainer were also androids and the fembots are properly though rarely referred to as gynoids from the same creator dr noonien soong earlier in star trek the motion picture one nine seven nine the ilia probe a precisely duplicated biomechanical

the mountains and enjoys the warmth brought by winter chinook winds while southeastern alberta is flat dry prairie where temperatures can range from very cold three five c three one f in the winter to very hot three five c nine five f or higher in the summer central and parts of northwestern alberta in the peace river region are largely aspen parkland a biome transitional between prairie to the south and boreal forest to the north after southern ontario central alberta is the most likely region in canada to experience tornadoes thunderstorms some of them severe are frequent in the summer especially in central and southern alberta the region surrounding the calgary edmonton corridor is notable for having the highest frequency of hail in canada overall alberta has cold winters with a daytime average of about one zero c one four f in the south to two four c one two f in the north in the summer the daytime temperature averages from about one three c five five f in the rocky mountains to one nine c six seven f in the dry prairie to the south east the northern and western parts of the province experience higher rainfall and lower evaporation rates caused by cooler summer temperatures alberta s capital city edmonton is located almost in the geographic centre of the province and most of alberta s oil is refined here southern alberta where calgary is located is known for its ranching much of the unforested part of alberta is given over either to grain or to dairy farming with ranching predominantly a southern alberta industry in southeastern alberta where the red deer river traverses the flat prairie and farmland are the alberta badlands with deep gorges and striking landforms dinosaur provincial park near drumheller alberta showcases the badlands terrain desert

article industry in alberta alberta is the largest producer of conventional crude oil synthetic crude natural gas and gas products in the country two of the largest producers of petrochemicals in north america are located in central and north central alberta in both red deer and edmonton world class polyethylene and vinyl manufacturers produce products shipped all over the world and edmonton s oil refineries provide the raw materials for a large petrochemical industry to the east of edmonton the athabasca oil sands previously known as the athabasca tar sands have estimated oil reserves in excess of that of the rest of the world estimated to be one six trillion barrels two five four km with the advancement of extraction methods bitumen and economical synthetic crude are produced at costs nearing that of conventional crude this technology is alberta grown and developed many companies employ both conventional strip mining and non conventional methods to extract the bitumen from the athabasca deposit with current technology only three one five billion barrels five zero km are recoverable fort mcmurray one of canada s youngest and liveliest cities has grown up entirely because of the large multinational corporations which have taken on the task of oil production another factor determining the viability of oil extraction from the tar sands is the price of oil in two zero zero five record oil prices have made it more than profitable to extract this oil which in the past would give little profit or even a loss while edmonton is considered the pipeline junction manufacturing chemical processing research and refining centre of the province calgary is known for its senior and junior oil company head offices unlike edmonton calgary is not close to any large sources of oil with concerted effort and support from the provincial government several high tech industries have found their birth in alberta notably the invention and perfection of liquid crystal display systems with a growing economy alberta has several financial institutions dealing with several civil and private funds agriculture and forestry farm buildings alberta canola field grain elevator alberta agriculture has a significant position in the province s economy over five million cattle are residents of the province at one time or another and alberta beef has a healthy worldwide market nearly one half of all canadian beef is produced in alberta alberta is one of the prime producers of plains buffalo bison for the consumer market sheep for wool and mutton are also raised wheat and canola are primary farm crops with alberta leading the provinces in spring wheat production with other grains also prominent much of the farming is dryland farming often with fallow seasons interspersed with cultivation continuous cropping in which there is no fallow season is gradually becoming a more common mode of production because of increased profits and a reduction of soil erosion across the province the once common grain elevator is slowly being lost as rail lines are decreased and farmers now truck the grain to central points alberta is the leading beekeeping province of canada with some beekeepers wintering hives indoors in specially designed barns in southern alberta then migrating north during the summer into the peace river valley where the season is short but the working days are long for honeybees to produce honey from clover and fireweed hybrid canola also requires bee pollination and some beekeepers service this need the vast northern forest reserves of softwood allow alberta to produce large quantities of lumber and plywood and several northern alberta plants supply north america and the pacific rim nations with bleached wood pulp and newsprint government see also politics of alberta edmonton is the seat of government of alberta it is a parliamentary democracy its unicameral legislature the legislative assembly consists of eight three members as canada s head of state queen elizabeth ii is the government of alberta s chief executive her duties in alberta are carried out by lieutenant governor norman kwong the government is headed by the premier ralph klein the city of edmonton is alberta s government capital the province s revenue comes mainly from the taxation of oil natural gas beef softwood lumber and wheat but also includes grants from the federal government primarily for infrastructure projects albertans are the lowest taxed people in canada and alberta is the only province in canada without a provincial sales tax though residents are still subject to the federal sales tax the gst alberta s municipalities have their own governments which usually work in co operation with the provincial government alberta s politics are much more conservative than those of other canadian provinces alberta has traditionally had three political parties the progressive conservatives conservatives or tories the centrist liberals and the social democratic new democrats a fourth party the strongly conservative social credit party was a power in alberta for many decades but fell from the political map after the progressive conservatives came to power in the early one nine seven zero s since that time no other political party has governed alberta in fact only three parties have governed alberta the united farmers of alberta the social credit party and the currently governing progressive conservative party as is the case with many western canadian provinces alberta has had occasional bouts of separatist sentiment even during the one nine eight zero s when these feelings were at their strongest there has never been enough interest in secession to initiate any major movements or referenda there are a number of groups wishing to promote the independence of alberta in some form currently active in the province see also alberta separatism in the two zero zero four provincial election held in november the alberta alliance party running to the right wing politics of the conservatives won one seat see also list of alberta premiers list of alberta general elections education as with any canadian province the alberta government is the highest authority in education creating and regulating the school boards public colleges universities and other educational institutions k one two the vast majority of alberta s schools are run by publicly funded school boards each with its own district of authority the largest are english language public school boards alberta also has english separate catholic boards throughout the province which serve a substantial minority of students there is one protestant school board in part of the province where numbers warrant there are francophone school boards public and separate catholic all five of these types of boards are primarily publicly funded basic school fees range from two zero zero seven five zero depending on the school board by local property taxes and provincial grants given on an equal per student basis by the province with some adjustments the different types of school boards are a necessity under the canadian constitution which guarantees the francophones and catholic communities both the right to their own schools and the right to administer them some other canadian provinces have reformed their school systems on non religious lines by seeking a constitutional amendment but alberta has not often the decision to go to one system or another is not based on religion but a parent s belief of which system provides a better education starting in one nine nine four the province has allowed some chartered schools to operate independently of any district school board reporting directly to the province homeschooling is officially recognized and partially funded from within the alberta school system originally in alberta school boards had the power to levy property taxes within their respective districts however this meant districts with a low tax base were underfunded so the province moved to a system that pools the education property tax and distributes it based on student population and need post secondary alberta s oldest and largest university is edmonton s university of alberta the university of calgary once affiliated with the university of alberta gained its autonomy in one nine six six and is now the second largest university in alberta there is also athabasca university which focuses on distance learning and the university of lethbridge there are one five colleges that receive direct public funding along with two technical institutes nait and sait students may also receive government loans and grants while attending selected private institutions transportation alberta has over one eight zero zero zero zero km of highways and roads of which nearly five zero zero zero zero km are paved the main north south corridor is highway two which begins south of cardston at the carway border crossing highway four which effectively extends u s interstate highway one five into alberta and is the busiest u s gateway to the province begins at the coutts border crossing and ends at lethbridge highway three joins lethbridge to fort macleod and links highway four to highway two highway two travels northward through fort macleod calgary red deer and edmonton before dividing into two highways one continues northwest as highway four three into grande prairie and the peace river country the other highway six three travels northeast to fort mcmurray the location of the athabasca oil sands highway two is supplimented by two more highways that run parallel to it highway two two west of highway two known as the cowboy trail and highway two one east of highway two alberta has two main east west corridors the southern corridor part of the trans canada highway system enters the province near medicine hat runs westward through calgary and leaves alberta through banff national park the northern corridor also part of the trans canada network but known alternatively as the yellowhead highway highway one six runs west from lloydminster in eastern alberta through edmonton and jasper national park into british columbia on a sunny spring or fall day one of the most scenic drives in the world is along the icefields parkway which runs some three zero zero km between jasper and banff with mountain ranges and glaciers on either side of its entire length urban stretches of alberta s major highways and freeways are often called trails for example highway two is deerfoot trail as it passes through calgary calgary trail as it leaves edmonton southbound and st albert trail as it leaves edmonton northbound toward the city of st albert visitors from outside alberta often find this disconcerting accustomed as they are to the notion that a trail is an unpaved route primarily for pedestrians edmonton calgary red deer medicine hat and lethbridge have substantial mass transit systems edmonton and calgary also operate light rail vehicles alberta is well connected by air with international airports at both edmonton and calgary calgary s airport is the larger of the two and is also the fourth busiest in canada it is a hub airport for a significant proportion of the connecting trans border and international flights into and out of central canada there are over nine zero zero zero km of operating mainline railway and many tourists see alberta aboard via rail or rocky mountain railtours culture main article culture of alberta alberta is well known for its warm and outgoing friendliness and frontier spirit whyte avenue edmonton summer brings many festivals to the province edmonton s fringe festival is the world s second largest after edinburgh s alberta also hosts some of canada s largest folk festivals multicultural festivals and heritage days to name a few calgary is also home to carifest the second largest caribbean festival in the nation after caribana in toronto these events highlight the province s cultural diversity and love of entertainment most of the major cities have several performing theatre companies who entertain in venues as diverse as edmonton s arts barns and the francis winspear centre alberta also has a large ethnic population both the chinese and east indian communities are significant according to statistics canada alberta is home to the second highest proportion two percent of francophones in western canada after manitoba many of alberta s french speaking residents live in the central and northwestern regions of the province as reported in the two zero zero one census the chinese represented nearly four percent of alberta s population and east indians represented better than two percent both edmonton and calgary have chinatowns and calgary s is canada s third largest aboriginal albertans make up approximately three percent of the population the major contributors to alberta s ethnic diversity have been the european nations forty four percent of albertans are of british and irish descent and there are also large numbers of germans ukrainians and scandinavians both cities heavily support first class canadian football league and national hockey league teams soccer rugby union and lacrosse are also played professionally in alberta tourism is also important to albertans a million visitors come to alberta each year just for calgary s world famous stampede and for edmonton s klondike days edmonton was the gateway to the only all canadian route to the yukon gold fields and the only route which did not require gold seekers to travel the exhausting and dangerous chilkoot pass stephen avenue calgary visitors throng to calgary for ten days every july for a taste of stampede fever as a celebration of canada s own wild west and the cattle ranching industry the stampede welcomes around one two million people each year only an hour s drive from the rocky mountains calgary also makes a visit to tourist attractions like banff national park something which can easily be done in a day calgary and banff each host nearly five million tourists yearly alberta is an important destination for tourists who love to ski and hike alberta boasts several world class ski resorts hunters and fishermen from around the world are able to take home impressive trophies and tall tales from their experiences in alberta s wilderness demographics alberta has enjoyed a relatively high rate of growth in recent years due in large part to its burgeoning economy between two zero zero three and two zero zero four the province saw high birthrates on par with some larger provinces such as british columbia relatively high immigration and a high rate of interprovincial migration when compared to other provinces as of two zero zero five the population of the province was three two one two eight one three albertans eight one of this population lives in urban areas and one nine is rural the calgary edmonton corridor is the most urbanized area in the province and one of the densest in canada many of alberta s cities and towns have also experienced very high rates of growth in recent history population of alberta since one nine zero one alberta s population has grown steadily for over a century racially and ethnically the province is predominantly caucasian eight eight eight of the population is either white or aboriginal aboriginals represent a fairly small proportion of this percentage however this number is significantly smaller in many of the cities particularly calgary and edmonton which are home to a much larger number of visible minorities visible minorities three three chinese two three asian one one black one one filipino most albertans identify as christians nevertheless many people in the province observe other faiths or do not profess to a religion at all alberta has a somewhat higher percentage of evangelical christians than do other provinces conversely alberta also has the second highest percentage of non religious residents in canada after british columbia the mormons of alberta reside primarily in the extreme south of the province there are temples in both cardston and edmonton many alberta mormons descend from mormon pioneers who emigrated from utah around the turn of the two zero th century alberta also has a large hutterite population a communal anabaptist sect similar to the mennonites and a significant population of seventh day adventists in and around the lacombe area due to the presence of the canadian university college many people of the hindu sikh and muslim faiths also make alberta their home one of the largest sikh temples in canada is located just outside of edmonton religion protestant three eight nine

province of alberta as far north as about five three north latitude was a part of rupert s land from the time of the incorporation of the hudson s bay company one six seven zero after the arrival in the north west of the french around one seven three one they settled the prairies of the west establishing communities such as lac la biche and bonnyville fort la jonqui re was established near what is now calgary in one seven five two the north west company of montreal occupied the northern part of alberta territory before the hudson s bay company arrived from hudson bay to take possession of it the first explorer of the athabasca region was peter pond who on behalf of the north west company of montreal built fort athabasca on lac la biche in one seven seven eight roderick mackenzie built fort chipewyan on lake athabasca ten years later in one seven eight eight his cousin sir alexander mackenzie followed the north saskatchewan river to its northernmost point near edmonton then setting northward on foot trekked to the athabasca river which he followed to lake athabasca it was there he discovered the mighty outflow river which bears his name the mackenzie river which he followed to its outlet in the arctic ocean returning to lake athabasca he followed the peace river upstream eventually reaching the pacific ocean and so being the first white man to cross the north american continent north of mexico the district of alberta was created as part of the north west territories in one eight eight two as settlement increased local representatives to the north west legislative assembly were added after a long campaign for autonomy in one nine zero five the district of alberta was enlarged and given provincial status fauna and flora fauna the three climatic regions alpine forest and prairie of alberta are home to many different species of animals the south and central prairie was the land of the bison its grasses providing a great pasture and breeding ground for millions of buffalo the buffalo population was decimated during early settlement but since then buffalo have made a strong comeback and thrive on farms and in parks all over alberta alberta is home to many large carnivores among them are the grizzly and black bears which are found in the mountains and wooded regions smaller carnivores of the dog and cat families include coyotes wolves fox lynx bobcat and mountain lion cougar rocky mountains bighorn sheep herbivorous or plant eating animals are found throughout the province moose and deer both mule and white tail varieties are found in the wooded regions and pronghorn antelope can be found in the prairies of southern alberta bighorn sheep and mountain goats live in the rocky mountains rabbits porcupines skunks squirrels and many species of rodents and reptiles live in every corner of the province alberta is fortunate in that it is home to only one variety of venomous snake the prairie rattlesnake central and northern alberta and the region farther north is the nesting ground of the migratory birds vast numbers of ducks geese swans and pelicans arrive in alberta every spring and nest on or near one of the hundreds of small lakes that dot northern alberta eagles hawks owls and crows are plentiful and a huge variety of smaller seed and insect eating birds can be found alberta like other temperate regions is home to mosquitoes flies wasps and bees rivers and lakes are well stocked with pike walleye white fish rainbow speckled and brown trout and even sturgeon turtles are found in some water bodies in the southern part of the province frogs and salamanders are a few of the amphibians that make their homes in alberta flora in central and northern alberta the arrival of spring brings the prairie anemone the avens crocuses and other early flowers the advancing summer introduces many flowers of the sunflower family until in august the plains are one blaze of yellow and purple the southern part of alberta is covered by a short grass very nutritive but dries up as summer lengthens to be replaced by hardy perennials such as the buffalo bean fleabane and sage both yellow and purple clover fill the roadways and the ditches with their beauty and aromatic scents the trees in the parkland region of the province grow in clumps and belts on the hillsides these are largely deciduous typically birch poplar and tamarack many species of willow and other shrubs grow in virtually any terrain on the north side of the north saskatchewan river evergreen forests prevail for hundreds of thousands of square kilometres aspen poplar balsam poplar or cottonwood and paper birch are the primary large deciduous species conifers include jack pine rocky mountain pine lodgepole pine both white and black spruce

parallel of latitude that in two zero zero zero runs six six three three three nine north of the equator everything north of this circle is known as the arctic and the zone just to the south of this circle is the northern temperate zone the arctic circle marks the southern extremity of the polar day of the summer solstice in june and the polar night of the winter solstice in december within the arctic circle the arctic sun is above the horizon for at least two four continuous hours once per year in conjunction with the arctic s summer solstice this is often referred to in local as midnight sun likewise in conjunction with the arctic s winter solstice the arctic sun will be below the horizon for at least two four continuous hours in fact because of refraction and because the sun appears as a disk and not a point part of the midnight sun may be seen at the night of the summer solstice up to about five zero nine zero km south of the geometric arctic circle similarly at the day of the winter solstice part of the sun may be seen up to about five zero north of the geometric arctic circle this is true at sea level these limits increase with elevation above sea level however in mountainous regions there is often no direct view of the horizon the position of the arctic circle is determined by the axial tilt angle of the polar axis of rotation of the earth on the ecliptic this angle is not constant but has a complex motion determined by many cycles of short to very long periods due to nutation the tilt oscillates over nine about two eight zero m on the surface over a period of one eight six years the main long term cycle has a period of four one zero zero zero years and an amplitude of about zero six eight or seven six km on the surface currently the tilt is decreasing by about zero four seven per year so the arctic circle is moving north by about one four m per year also see precession countries which have significant territory within the arctic circle are russia

this version was adopted in one nine eight two an assault rifle is a type of automatic rifle generally defined as a selective fire rifle or carbine depending on the particular firearm s size using intermediate powered ammunition they are categorized between the larger and heavier light machine gun and the weaker submachine gun assault rifles are the standard small arm in most modern armies having largely replaced or suplemented the larger more powerful rifles of the past the name is a literal translation of the german term sturmgewehr or storm weapon first applied to the sturmgewehr four four developed during world war ii it gradually became a popular term for this type of firearm the term has since been retro actively applied to earlier weapons with similar traits history one nine zero zero s to the one nine three zero s light automatic rifles using rifle cartridges federov avtomat russia the weapon fired the japanese rifle cartridge these automatic firearms tended to use used pre existing rifle cartridges kinetic energy ranged between three zero zero zero five zero zero zero j two two zero zero three seven zero zero foot pounds velocites of seven five zero nine zero zero m s two four six zero two nine five zero ft s and bullets of nine to one three g one three nine two zero zero grains the first true assault rifle was probably the italian made cei rigotti which was developed in the one eight nine zero s and finished around one nine zero zero at the beginning of the two zero th century it never entered military service however the first service assault rifle was the russian federov avtomat of one nine one six chambered for the japanese arisaka six five five zero mm rifle cartridge which was only used in small numbers due to supply problems the browning automatic rifle bar was a world war i era weapon that used a full power round it was an automatic rifle by today s definition and designed for single accurate shots and suppressive automatic fire the weight of roughly one five pounds seven kg meant that it was rather cumbersome for closer quarters later developments added heavier barrels and bipods that lent it to being used as more like today s light machine gun or squad automatic weapon though it did help establish the doctrine of use for light selective fire rifles the bar was produced in large numbers widely adopted and served into the one nine six zero s with the u s military and other nations while it did not use an intermediate cartridge it was an intermediate weapon between the newly adopted submachine guns and heavier machine guns such as the lewis gun during wwi a few weaker submachine guns also entered service such as the villar perosa the berretta one nine one eight and the mp one eight these weapons fired rounds based of pistols nine mm glisenti and nine mm bergmann the nine mm bergman was based on the nine mm parabellum with reduced charge to reduce recoil in the mp one eight the developers of the thompson submachine gun also developed during the one nine one zero s originally intended to use rifle powered rounds however a mechanical system that could handle their power was not found and it ended up using the four five acp cartridge these firearms are considered part of the submachine gun class but were an important part in the development of the assault rifles one nine three zero s automatic intermediate weapons some of these automatic and semi automatic firearms used new intermediate cartridges others used pre existing rounds an attempt to provide soldiers with a rifle with intermediate power ammunition that was heavier than a submachine gun too weak with short range due to the pistol ammunition but lighter than a long rifle uncomfortable to fire and difficult to control on fully automatic mode due to the powerful ammunition more expensive to design and manufacture by the italian arms company beretta resulted in the mab three eight moschetto automatico beretta one nine three eight the mab three eight used a fiocchi nine m three eight cartridge and a higher powered nine mm parabellum cartridge which could provide longer range fire the effective range was about two zero zero m although it was declared to be effective up to five zero zero m the mab three eight was a multipurpose weapon m one carbine u s unlike the m one the later m two and m three were fully automatic in one nine three eight prior to world war ii the united states introduced the m one carbine which was an intermediate power weapon chambered for the three zero carbine cartridge the m one carbine was originally planned to have automatic fire but this was dropped from the first version although later in the war selective fire variants were made m two and m three carbines the weapon had higher stopping power than submachine guns but was not as powerful as full size automatic rifles such as the bar the longer barrel one eight inch provided the carbine with higher muzzle velocity than pistols and submachine guns chambered for the same three zero round the m one carbine series was designed for close quarters engagements a concept that would be re applied later it marked the first time in which such an intermediate weapon would be mass produced in such large numbers it became the most produced american weapon of the war with millions made the m one carbine series would remain in service with the u s military until replaced by the m one six rifle in the one nine six zero s it continued to be used in other nations one nine four zero s and one nine five zero s maschinenkarabiner sturmgewehr others used new intermediate cartridges kinetic energy ranged between one four zero zero two one zero zero j one zero three three one five five zero foot pounds muzzle velocities of six zero zero eight zero zero m s one nine seven zero two six two five ft s and bullets of seven nine g one zero eight one three nine grains germany like other countries had studied the problem since world war i and their factories made a variety of non standard cartridges therefore having less incentive to retain their existing calibers the seven nine two three zero mm cartridge was an example of these experiments in one nine four one it was improved to seven nine two three three mm infanterie kurz patrone infantry short standard in one nine four two it was again improved as maschinenkarabiner patrone s and in one nine four three pistolen patrone four three me then finally infanterie kurz patrone four three it is just a coincidence but the intermediate cartridge developed by winchester for the m one carbine developed slightly before also measured three three mm in one nine four two walther presented the maschinenkarabiner automatic carbine abbr mkb named mkb four two w in the same year haenel presented the mkb four two h designed by hugo schmeisser as a result of this program rheinmetall borsig some said krieghoff presented its fg four two fallschirmjaeger gewehr four two sponsored by hermann g ring though this was in a different role and using a heavy eight five seven mm eight mm mauser cartridge which was not an intermediate round war time tests in russia indicated the mkb four two h performed better than the other two schmeisser developed it first as the mp four three then mp four three one and finally as the mp four four sturmgewehr four four abbreviated stg four four it immediately entered large scale production more than five zero zero zero units had been produced by february one nine four four and five five zero zero zero by the following november following the end of the war the soviet union developed the ak four seven which was vaguely similar in concept and layout to the german stg four four but extremely different mechanically it fired the seven six two three nine mm cartridge which had been developed during wwii the round was similar to the stg four four s in that the bullet was of a similar caliber to the russian rifle ammunition one nine six zero s and one nine seven zero s lighter automatic weapons and lighter smaller bullets many of these automatic firearms used intermediate cartridges with much lighter bullets and smaller calibers but fired at very high velocity kinetic energy ranged between one three zero zero one eight zero zero j nine six zero one three three zero foot pounds velocities of nine zero zero one zero five zero m s two nine five zero three four five zero ft s and bullets of three four g four six six two grains sig five five zero swiss the sig fires gw pat nine zero which has the same caliber as the five five six mm nato many nations continued the development of traditional high powered rifles with ranges of five zero zero meters five five zero yards and beyond most designs of this period used low caliber but high velocity ammunition with some experiments in flechettes and other exotic ammunition statistical studies of world war ii battles performed by the u s army revealed that infantry combat beyond three zero zero meters three two five yards was rare the russians saw no reason to make a rifle that shot beyond a rifleman s ability to aim therefore a lighter less powerful cartridge could be effective this permitted a lighter rifle and enabled troops to carry more ammunition making them more autonomous a greater amount of the lighter ammunition could be transported in the same amount of space in addition the smaller size and handiness of an assault rifle would benefit tank crews support troops and units with missions other than front line combat the five five six four five mm nato cartridge was developed in the one nine six zero s and was adopted for use in the m one six assault rifle the m one six a one version soon followed and was then replaced in one nine eight two by the m one six a two the soviet union also developed its own similar round the five four five three nine mm which was used in the ak seven four the successor of the ak four seven these rounds are usually considered less lethal than the previous generation of assault rifle rounds that fired larger rifle caliber ammunition with reduced propellant but the smaller caliber and lighter bullets achieve higher velocities than even a hunting rifle bullet these high speeds induce additional lethality through bullet shattering although these high speed rounds generally do not exceed the momentum of the heavier but slower bullets of the less sophisticated ak four seven any pointed spitzer round will tumble in soft tissue if the jacket has a cannelure like the u s five five six four five mm m one nine three round the bullet will fragment leading to significant blood loss and internal damage blood loss leads to indirect incapacitation but often takes longer than direct destruction of tissue since combat use of rifles expends around five zero zero zero zero rounds in suppressive fire for each combatant killed trading lighter cartridge weight and lower recoil for slower but more sure incapacitation often makes good sense the key to the assault rifle concept is firing at both known and suspected enemy positions this allows an attacking infantry unit to shoot at a hidden enemy first rather than waiting for the enemy to fire first good volume and distribution of aimed suppressive fire delivered by infantry squad members as they maneuver prevents enemy return fire and in turn allows the assaulting unit to maneuver through enemy fields of fire faster faster maneuver limits the assaulting unit s vulnerability to small arms fire artillery mortars or counter attack of course this requires a larger basic ammunition load and steady supply of rifle ammunition one nine seven zero s one nine eight zero s one nine nine zero s new form factors and features many of these automatic firearms usually used the same rounds as in older eras but focused on using new form factors materials and added features like standard telescopic and reflex sights famas france it was adopted in one nine seven eight the biggest change since adoption of high velocity rounds of five mm caliber and higher has been designs that have new form factors sights electronics and materials a number of bullpup rifles entered service in the late one nine seven zero s one nine eight zero s and one nine nine zero s although bullpup rifles had existed since the one nine three zero s the united kingdom s em two was one of the few bullpup assault rifles prior to this time examples of the new trend include the famas steyr aug and sa eight zero they were all bullpup rifles that made heavy use of composites and plastics with ambidextrous controls and the latter both added a low power telescopic sight to the standard service version the sar two one the tavor tar two one and qbz nine five follow a similar trend as well with a bullpup configuration and heavy use of composites the heckler seven mm range with rifle round velocities and lower mass bullets a kind of intermediate philosophy between the smaller caliber faster modern rounds and the standard caliber slower rounds of the previous generation china in the late one nine eight zero s introduced a five eight four two mm round with an initial velocity of nine three zero m s four two six g bullet and one eight four two j of energy china claims the new round provides superior performace and lethality to the nato and modern soviet intermediate rounds in the united states remington has developed the six eight mm remington spc cartridge which is the same overall length at the five five six x four five mm nato round but fires a bullet the same caliber at the two seven zero winchester hunting cartridge its similar size to the five five six four five mm means that existing rifles can be converted without an excessive amount of trouble development of a four seven three mm caseless ammunition and advanced assault rifle in the one nine seven zero one nine eight zero s by germany was effectively halted by the german reunification in one nine nine zero and that rifle never entered full production assault weapons vs fully automatic weapons primarily in the united states the term assault weapon is an arbitrary and politicized phrase generally used to describe a collection of semi automatic firearms that have certain features associated with military police use such as a folding stock flash suppressor bayonet protruding pistol grip or the ability to accept a detachable magazine of a capacity larger than ten rounds the phrase assault weapon has been used primarily in relation to a specific expired gun law that was commonly known as the assault weapons ban clinton gun ban or one nine nine four crime bill it is a common misconception that the assault weapons ban restricted weapons capable of fully automatic fire such as assault rifles and machine guns fully automatic weapons were unaffected by the ban because they have been heavily restricted since the national firearms act of one nine three four and other more recent laws the term assault weapon has often been erroneously used to describe machine guns many states and localities still use the term assault weapon with a variety of variations following the california model loosely see separate article on assault weapons for further information see also automatic firearm for clarification on similar categories battle rifle

organisms classified as the kingdom animalia or metazoa in general they are multicellular capable of locomotion and responsive to their environment and feed by consuming other organisms their body plan becomes fixed as they develop usually early on in their development as embryos although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later on the name animal comes from the latin word animal of which animalia is the plural and ultimately from anima meaning vital breath or soul characteristics kingdom animalia has several characteristics that set it apart from other living things animals are eukaryotic and multicellular which separates them from bacteria and most protists they are heterotrophic generally digesting food in an internal chamber which separates them from plants and algae they are also distinguished from plants algae and fungi by lacking cell walls structure with a few exceptions most notably the sponges phylum porifera animals have bodies differentiated into separate tissues these include muscles which are able to contract and control locomotion and a nervous system which sends and processes signals there is also typically an internal digestive chamber with one or two openings animals with this sort of organization are called metazoans or eumetazoans when the former is used for animals in general all animals have eukaryotic cells surrounded by a characteristic extracellular matrix composed of collagen and elastic glycoproteins this may be calcified to form structures like shells bones and spicules during development it forms a relatively flexible framework upon which cells can move about and be reorganized making complex structures possible in contrast other multicellular organisms like plants and fungi have cells held in place by cell walls and so develop by progressive growth also unique to animal cells are the following intercellular junctions tight junctions gap junctions and desmosomes reproduction and development nearly all animals undergo some form of sexual reproduction adults are diploid or occasionally polyploid they have a few specialized reproductive cells which undergo meiosis to produce smaller motile spermatozoa or larger non motile ova these fuse to form zygotes which develop into new individuals many animals are also capable of asexual reproduction this may take place through parthenogenesis where fertile eggs are produced without mating or in some cases through fragmentation a zygote initially develops into a hollow sphere called a blastula which undergoes rearrangement and differentiation in sponges blastula larvae swim to a new location and develop into a new sponge in most other groups the blastula undergoes more complicated rearrangement it first invaginates to form a gastrula with a digestive chamber and two separate germ layers an external ectoderm and an internal endoderm in most cases a mesoderm also develops between them these germ layers then differentiate to form tissues and organs animals grow by indirectly using the energy of sunlight plants use this energy to turn air into simple sugars using a process known as photosynthesis these sugars are then used as the building blocks which allow the plant to grow when animals eat these plants or eat other animals which have eaten plants the sugars produced by the plant are used by the animal they are either used directly to help the animal grow or broken down releasing stored solar energy and giving the animal the energy required for motion this process is known as glycolysis origin and fossil record animals are generally considered to have evolved from flagellate protozoa their closest living relatives are the choanoflagellates collared flagellates that have the same structure as certain sponge cells do molecular studies place them in a supergroup called the opisthokonts which also include the fungi and a few small parasitic protists the name comes from the posterior location of the flagellum in motile cells such as most animal sperm whereas other eukaryotes tend to have anterior flagella the first fossils that might represent animals appear towards the end of the precambrian around six zero zero million years ago and are known as the vendian biota these are difficult to relate to later fossils however some may represent precursors of modern phyla but they may be separate groups and it is possible they are not really animals at all aside from them most known animal phyla make a more or less simultaneous appearance during the cambrian period about five seven zero million years ago it is still disputed whether this event called the cambrian explosion represents a rapid divergence between different groups or a change in conditions that made fossilization possible groups of animals elephant ear sponge the sponges porifera diverged from other animals early as mentioned they lack the complex organization found in most other phyla their cells are differentiated but not organized into distinct tissues sponges are sessile and typically feed by drawing in water through pores archaeocyatha which have fused skeletons may represent sponges or a separate phylum brain coral among the eumetazoan phyla two are radially symmetric and have digestive chambers with a single opening which serves as both the mouth and the anus these are the cnidaria which include sea anemones corals and jellyfish and the ctenophora or comb jellies both have distinct tissues but they are not organized into organs there are only two main germ layers the ectoderm and endoderm with only scattered cells between them as such these animals are sometimes called diploblastic the tiny phylum placozoa is similar but individuals do not have a permanent digestive chamber the remaining animals form a monophyletic group called the bilateria for the most part they are bilaterally symmetric and often have a specialized head with feeding and sensory organs the body is triploblastic i e all three germ layers are well developed and tissues form distinct organs the digestive chamber has two openings a mouth and an anus and there is also an internal body cavity called a coelom or pseudocoelom there are exceptions to each of these characteristics however for instance adult echinoderms are radially symmetric and certain parasitic worms have extremely simplified body structures clownfish in their sea anemone home genetic studies have considerably changed our understanding of the relationships within the bilateria most appear to belong to four major lineages deuterostomes ecdysozoa platyzoa lophotrochozoa in addition to these there are a few small groups of bilaterians with relatively similar structure that appear to have diverged before these major groups these include the acoelomorpha rhombozoa and orthonectida the myxozoa single celled parasites that were originally considered protozoa are now believed to have developed from the bilateria as well the magellanic penguin deuterostomes deuterostomes differ from the other bilateria called protostomes in several ways in both cases there is a complete digestive tract however in protostomes the initial opening the archenteron develops into the mouth and an anus forms separately in deuterostomes this is reversed in most protostomes cells simply fill in the interior of the gastrula to form the mesoderm called schizocoelous development but in deuterostomes it forms through invagination of the endoderm called enterocoelic pouching deuterostomes also have a dorsal rather than a ventral nerve chord and their embryos undergo different cleavage all this suggests the deuterostomes and protostomes are separate monophyletic lineages the main phyla of deuterostomes are the echinodermata and chordata the former are radially symmetric and exclusively marine such as sea stars sea urchins and sea cucumbers the latter are dominated by the vertebrates animals with backbones these include fish amphibians reptiles birds and mammals in addition to these the deuterostomes also include the hemichordata or acorn worms although they are not especially prominent today the important fossil graptolites may belong to this group the chaetognatha or arrow worms may also be deuterostomes but this is less certain ecdysozoa the yellow winged darter the ecdysozoa are protostomes named after the common trait of growth by moulting or ecdysis the largest animal phylum belongs here the arthropoda including insects spiders crabs and their kin all these organisms have a body divided into repeating segments typically with paired appendages two smaller phyla the onychophora and tardigrada are close relatives of the arthropods and share these traits roundworm the ecdysozoans also include the nematoda or roundworms the second largest animal phylum roundworms are typically microscopic and occur in nearly every environment where there is water a number are important parasites smaller phyla related to them are the nematomorpha or horsehair worms which are visible to the unaided eye and the kinorhyncha priapulida and loricifera which are all microscopic these groups have a reduced coelom called a pseudocoelom the remaining two groups of protostomes are sometimes grouped together as the spiralia since in both embryos develop with spiral cleavage bedford s flatworm platyzoa the platyzoa include the phylum platyhelminthes the flatworms these were originally considered some of the most primitive bilateria but it now appears they developed from more complex ancestors rotifer a number of parasites are included in this group such as the flukes and tapeworms flatworms lack a coelom as do their closest relatives the microscopic gastrotricha the other platyzoan phyla are microscopic and pseudocoelomate the most prominent are the rotifera or rotifers which are common in aqueous environments they also include the acanthocephala or spiny headed worms the gnathostomulida micrognathozoa and possibly the cycliophora these groups share the presence of complex jaws from which they are called the gnathifera lophotrochozoa big blue octopus the lophotrochozoa include two of the most successful animal phyla the mollusca and annelida the former includes animals such as snails clams and squids and the latter comprises the segmented worms such as earthworms and leeches these two groups have long been considered close relatives because of the common presence of trochophore larvae but the annelids were considered closer to the arthropods because they are both segmented now this is generally considered convergent evolution owing to many morphological and genetic differences between the two phyla the lophotrochozoa also include the nemertea or ribbon worms the sipuncula and several phyla that have a fan of cilia around the mouth called a lophophore these were traditionally grouped together as the lophophorates but it now appears they are paraphyletic some closer to the nemertea and some to the mollusca and annelida they include the brachiopoda or lamp shells which are prominent in the fossil record the entoprocta the phoronida and possibly the bryozoa or moss animals history of classification white s tree frog vulpes vulpes the red fox aristotle divided the living world between animals and plants and this was followed by carolus linnaeus in the first hierarchical classification since then biologists have begun emphasizing evolutionary relationships and so these groups have been restricted somewhat for instance microscopic protozoa were originally considered animals because they move but are now treated separately in linnaeus original scheme the animals were one of three kingdoms divided into the classes of vermes insecta pisces amphibia aves and mammalia since then the last four have all been subsumed into a single phylum the chordata whereas the various other forms have been separated out the above lists represent our current understanding of the group though there is some variation from source to source usage of the word animal in everyday usage animal refers to any member of the animal kingdom that is not a human being and sometimes excludes insects although including such arthropods as crabs this confusion stems primarily from the familiarity with zoo animals farm animals and pets not from an analytical distinction between insects humans

references ray finned fish bony fish albert einstein photographed by oren j turner in one nine four seven albert einstein march one four one eight seven nine april one eight one nine five five was a german born theoretical physicist widely regarded as the greatest scientist of the two zero th century he was the author of the general theory of relativity and made important contributions to the special theory of relativity quantum mechanics statistical mechanics and cosmology he was awarded the one nine two one nobel prize for physics for his explanation of the photoelectric effect in one nine zero five his miracle year and for his services to theoretical physics after british solar eclipse expeditions in one nine one nine confirmed that light rays from distant stars were deflected by the gravity of the sun in the exact amount he predicted in his general theory of relativity einstein became world famous an unusual achievement for a scientist in his later years his fame exceeded that of any other scientist in history in popular culture his name has become synonymous with great intelligence and genius biography young einstein before the einsteins moved from germany to italy youth and college einstein was born on march one four one eight seven nine at ulm in baden w rttemberg german empire about one zero zero km east of stuttgart his parents were hermann einstein a featherbed salesman who later ran an electrochemical works and pauline whose maiden name was koch they were married in stuttgart bad cannstatt the family was jewish non observant albert attended a catholic elementary school and at the insistence of his mother was given violin lessons though he initially disliked and eventually discontinued the lessons he would later take great solace in mozart s violin sonatas when albert was five his father showed him a pocket compass and einstein realized that something in empty space acted upon the needle he would later describe the experience as one of the most revelatory of his life though he built models and mechanical devices for fun and showed great mathematical faculty early on he was considered a slow learner possibly due to dyslexia simple shyness or the significantly rare and unusual structure of his brain examined after his death he later credited his development of the theory of relativity to this slowness saying that by pondering space and time later than most children he was able to apply a more developed intellect some researchers have speculated that einstein may have exhibited some traits of mild forms of autism although they concede that a reliable posthumous diagnosis is impossible in one eight eight nine a student named max talmud introduced einstein to key science and philosophy texts including kant s critique of pure reason two of his uncles would further foster his intellectual interests during his late childhood and early adolescence by suggesting and providing books on science mathematics and philosophy einstein attended the luitpold gymnasium where he received a relatively progressive education he began to learn mathematics around age twelve in one eight nine one he taught himself euclidean plane geometry from a school booklet and began to study calculus there is a recurring rumor that he failed mathematics later in his education but this is untrue a change in the way grades were assigned caused confusion years later while there he clashed with authority and resented the school regimen believing the spirit of learning and creative thought were lost in such an endeavor as strict memorization in one eight nine four following the failure of hermann s electrochemical business the einsteins moved from munich to pavia italy near milan einstein s first scientific work was written therein called the investigation of the state of aether in magnetic fields albert remained behind in munich lodgings to finish school completing only one term before leaving the gymnasium in spring one eight nine five to rejoin his family in pavia he quit without telling his parents and a year and a half prior to final examinations einstein convinced the school to let him go with a medical note from a friendly doctor but this meant he had no secondary school certificate that year at the age of one six he performed the thought experiment known as albert einstein s mirror after gazing into a mirror he examined what would happen to his image if he were moving at the speed of light his conclusion that the speed of light is independent of the observer would later become one of the two postulates of special relativity despite excelling in the mathematics and science portion his failure of the liberal arts portion of the eidgen ssische technische hochschule eth swiss federal institute of technology in zurich entrance exam the following year was a setback his family sent him to aarau switzerland to finish secondary school where he studied the seldom taught maxwell s electromagnetic theory and received his diploma in september one eight nine six during this time he lodged with professor jost winteler s family and became enamoured with marie their daughter his first sweetheart albert s sister maja was to later marry their son paul and his friend michele besso married their other daughter anna einstein subsequently enrolled at the eidgen ssische technische hochschule in october and moved to zurich while marie moved to olsberg for a teaching post the same year he renounced his w rttemberg citizenship and became stateless in the spring of one eight nine six the serbian mileva mari started initially as a medical student at the university of zurich but after a term switched to the same section as einstein as the only woman that year to study for the same diploma einstein s relationship with mileva developed into romance over the next few years in one nine zero zero he was granted a teaching diploma by the eidgen ssische technische hochschule eth zurich einstein then wrote his first published paper on the capillary forces of a drinking straw wherein he tried to unify the laws of physics an attempt he would continually make throughout his life it was titled folgerungen aus den capillarit tserscheinungen which translated is consequences of the observations of capillarity phenomena found in annalen der physik volume four page five one three shortly following einstein was accepted as a swiss citizen in one nine zero one he kept his swiss passport for his whole life through his friend michelle besso an engineer he was presented with the works of ernst mach and later would consider him the best sounding board in europe for physical ideas during this time einstein discussed his scientific interests with a group of close friends including besso and mileva the men referred to themselves as the olympia academy he and mileva had an illegitimate daughter lieserl born in january one nine zero two work and doctorate einstein in one nine zero five when he wrote the annus mirabilis papers upon graduation einstein could not find a teaching post mostly because his brashness as a young man had apparently irritated most of his professors the father of a classmate helped him obtain employment as a technical assistant examiner at the swiss patent office in one nine zero two there einstein judged the worth of inventors patent applications for devices that required a knowledge of physics to understand in particular he was chiefly charged to evaluate patents relating to electromagnetic devices he also learned how to discern the essence of applications despite sometimes poor descriptions and was taught by the director how to express himself correctly he occasionally rectified their design errors while evaluating the practicality of their work einstein married mileva mari on january six one nine zero three einstein s marriage to mari who was a mathematician was both a personal and intellectual partnership einstein referred to mileva as a creature who is my equal and who is as strong and independent as i am ronald w clark a biographer of einstein claimed that einstein depended on the distance that existed in his and mileva s marriage in order to have the solitude necessary to accomplish his work he required intellectual isolation abram joffe a soviet physicist who knew einstein in an obituary of einstein wrote the author of the papers of one nine zero five was a bureaucrat at the patent office in bern einstein mari and this has recently been taken as evidence of a collaborative relationship however according to alberto a mart nez of the center for einstein studies at boston university joffe only ascribed authorship to einstein as he believed that it was a swiss custom at the time to append the spouse s last name to the husband s name whatever the truth the extent of her influence on einstein s work is a highly controversial and debated question on may one four one nine zero four the couple s first son hans albert einstein was born in one nine zero three einstein s position at the swiss patent office had been made permanent though he was passed over for promotion until he had fully mastered machine technology he obtained his doctorate after submitting his thesis a new determination of molecular dimensions eine neue bestimmung der molek ldimensionen in one nine zero five that same year he wrote four articles that provided the foundation of modern physics without much scientific literature to which he could refer or many scientific colleagues with whom he could discuss the theories most physicists agree that three of those papers on brownian motion the photoelectric effect and special relativity deserved nobel prizes only the paper on the photoelectric effect would be mentioned by the nobel committee in the award this is ironic not only because einstein is far better known for relativity but also because the photoelectric effect is a quantum phenomenon and einstein became somewhat disenchanted with the path quantum theory would take in each of these papers einstein boldly took an idea from theoretical physics to its logical consequences and managed to explain experimental results that had baffled scientists for decades max planck and einstein annus mirabilis papers einstein submitted the series of papers to the annalen der physik they are commonly referred to as the annus mirabilis papers from annus mirabilis latin for year of wonders the international union of pure and applied physics iupap commemorated the one zero zero th year of the publication of einstein s extensive work in one nine zero five as the world year of physics two zero zero five the first paper named on a heuristic viewpoint concerning the production and transformation of light ber einen die erzeugung und verwandlung des lichtes betreffenden heuristischen gesichtspunkt proposed that energy quanta which are essentially what we now call photons were real and showed how they could be used to explain such phenomena as the photoelectric effect this paper was specifically cited for his nobel prize max planck had made the formal assumption that energy was quantized in deriving his black body radiation law published in one nine zero one but had considered this to be no more than a mathematical trick the photoelectric effect thus provided a simple confirmation of max planck s hypothesis of quanta his second article in one nine zero five named on the motion required by the molecular kinetic theory of heat of small particles suspended in a stationary liquid ber die von der molekularkinetischen theorie der w rme geforderte bewegung von in ruhenden fl ssigkeiten suspendierten teilchen covered his study of brownian motion and provided empirical evidence for the existence of atoms before this paper atoms were recognized as a useful concept but physicists and chemists hotly debated whether atoms were real entities einstein s statistical discussion of atomic behavior gave experimentalists a way to count atoms by looking through an ordinary microscope wilhelm ostwald one of the leaders of the anti atom school later told arnold sommerfeld that he had been converted to a belief in atoms by einstein s complete explanation of brownian motion at the same time as einstein brownian motion was also described by smoluchowski einstein s third paper that year on the electrodynamics of moving bodies zur elektrodynamik bewegter k rper was published in september one nine zero five this paper introduced the special theory of relativity a theory of time distance mass and energy which was consistent with electromagnetism but omitted the force of gravity while developing this paper einstein wrote to mileva about our work on relative motion and this has led some to ask whether mileva played a part in its development a few historians of science believe that einstein and his wife were both aware that the famous frenchman henri poincar had already published the equations of relativity a few weeks before einstein submitted his paper most believe their work independent especially given einstein s isolation at this time a fourth paper does the inertia of a body depend upon its energy content ist die tr gheit eines k rpers von seinem energieinhalt abh ngig published late in one nine zero five showed one further deduction from relativity s axioms the famous equation that the energy of a body at rest e equals its mass m times the speed of light c squared e mc middle years einstein at the one nine one one solvay conference in one nine zero six einstein was promoted to technical examiner second class in one nine zero eight einstein was licensed in bern switzerland as a privatdozent unsalaried teacher at a university einstein s second son eduard was born on july two eight one nine one zero at this time he described why the sky is blue in his paper on the phenomenon of critical opalescence which shows the cumulative effect of scattering of light by individual molecules in the atmosphere in one nine one one einstein became first associate professor at the university of zurich and shortly afterwards full professor at the german university of prague only to return the following year to zurich in order to become full professor at the eth zurich at that time he worked closely with the mathematician marcel grossmann in one nine one two einstein started to refer to time as the fourth dimension although h g wells had done this earlier in one eight nine five in the time machine in one nine one four just before the start of world war i einstein settled in berlin as professor at the local university and became a member of the prussian academy of sciences he took german citizenship his pacifism and jewish origins irritated german nationalists after he became world famous nationalistic hatred of him grew and for the first time he was the subject of an organized campaign to discredit his theories from one nine one four to one nine three three he served as director of the kaiser wilhelm institute for physics in berlin and it was during this time that he was awarded his nobel prize and made his most groundbreaking discoveries he was also an extraordinary professor at the leiden university from one nine two zero until officially one nine four six where he regularly gave guest lectures in one nine one seven einstein published on the quantum mechanics of radiation zur quantenmechanik der strahlung physkalische zeitschrift one eight one two one one two eight this article introduced the concept of stimulated emission the physical principle that allows light amplification in the laser he also published a paper that year that used the general theory of relativity to model the behavior of the entire universe setting the stage for modern cosmology in this work he created his self described worst blunder the cosmological constant einstein divorced mileva on february one four one nine one nine and married his cousin elsa l wenthal born einstein l wenthal was the surname of her first husband max on june two one nine one nine elsa was albert s first cousin maternally and his second cousin paternally she was three years older than albert and had nursed him to health after he had suffered a partial nervous breakdown combined with a severe stomach ailment there were no children from this marriage the fate of albert and mileva s first child lieserl is unknown some believe she died in infancy while others believe she was given out for adoption they later had two sons eduard and hans albert eduard intended to practice as a freudian analyst but was institutionalized for schizophrenia and died in an asylum hans albert his older brother became a professor of hydraulic engineering at the university of california berkeley having little interaction with his father einstein theory triumphs declared the new york times on november one zero one nine one nine general relativity in november one nine one five einstein presented a series of lectures before the prussian academy of sciences in which he described his theory of gravity known as general relativity the final lecture climaxed with his introduction of an equation that replaced newton s law of gravity the field equation which was first derived from a variational principle by david hilbert this theory considered all observers to be equivalent not only those moving at a uniform speed in general relativity gravity is no longer a force as it is in newton s law of gravity but is a consequence of the curvature of space time the theory provided the foundation for the study of cosmology and gave scientists the tools for understanding many features of the universe that were discovered well after einstein s death a truly revolutionary theory general relativity has so far passed every test posed to it and has become a powerful tool used in the analysis of many subjects in physics initially scientists were skeptical because the theory was derived by mathematical reasoning and rational analysis not by experiment or observation but in one nine one nine predictions made using the theory were confirmed by arthur eddington s measurements during a solar eclipse of how much the light emanating from a star was bent by the sun s gravity when it passed close to the sun an effect called gravitational lensing the observations were carried out on may two nine one nine one nine at two locations one in sobral cear brazil and another in the island of principe in the west coast of africa on november seven the times reported the confirmation cementing einstein s fame many scientists were still unconvinced for various reasons ranging from disagreement with einstein s interpretation of the experiments to not being able to tolerate the absence of an absolute frame of reference in einstein s view many of them simply could not understand the mathematics involved einstein s public fame which followed the one nine one nine article created resentment among these scientists some of which lasted well into the one nine three zero s in the early one nine two zero s einstein was the lead figure in a famous weekly physics colloquium at the university of berlin on march three zero one nine two one einstein went to new york to give a lecture on his new theory of relativity the same year he was awarded the nobel prize though he is now most famous for his work on relativity it was for his earlier work on the photoelectric effect that he was given the prize as his work on general relativity was still disputed the nobel committee decided that citing his less contested theory in the prize would gain more acceptance from the scientific community sir edmund whittaker one nine five three stated that david hilbert published the theory of general relativity nearly simultaneously with einstein the copenhagen interpretation einstein and niels bohr sparred over quantum theory during the one nine two zero s einstein s postulation that light can be described not only as a wave with no kinetic energy but also as massless discrete packets of energy called quanta with measurable kinetic energy now known as photons was a landmark break with the classical physics in one nine zero nine einstein presented his first paper on the quantification of light to a gathering of physicists and told them that they must find some way to understand waves and particles together in the mid one nine two zero s as the original quantum theory was replaced with a new theory of quantum mechanics einstein balked at the copenhagen interpretation of the new equations because it settled for a probabilistic non visualizable account of physical behaviour einstein agreed that the theory was the best available but he looked for a more complete explanation i e more deterministic he could not abandon the belief that physics described the laws that govern real things the belief which had led to his successes with atoms photons and gravity in a one nine two six letter to max born einstein made a remark that is now famous quantum mechanics is certainly imposing but an inner voice tells me it is not yet the real thing the theory says a lot but does not really bring us any closer to the secret of the old one i at any rate am convinced that he does not throw dice to this bohr who sparred with einstein on quantum theory retorted stop telling god what he must do the bohr einstein debates on foundational aspects of quantum mechanics happened during the solvay conferences einstein was not rejecting probabilistic theories per se einstein himself was a great statistician using statistical analysis in his works on brownian motion and photoelectricity and in papers published before the miraculous year one nine zero five einstein had even discovered gibbs ensembles he believed however that at the core reality behaved deterministically many physicists argue that experimental evidence contradicting this belief was found much later with the discovery of bell s theorem and bell s inequality nonetheless there is still space for lively discussions about the interpretation of quantum mechanics bose einstein statistics in one nine two four einstein received a short paper from a young indian physicist named satyendra nath bose describing light as a gas of photons and asking for einstein s assistance in publication einstein realized that the same statistics could be applied to atoms and published an article in german then the lingua franca of physics which described bose s model and explained its implications bose einstein statistics now describe any assembly of these indistinguishable particles known as bosons the bose einstein condensate phenomenon was predicted in the one nine two zero s by bose and einstein based on bose s work on the statistical mechanics of photons which was then formalized and generalized by einstein the first such condensate was produced by eric cornell and carl wieman in one nine nine five at the university of colorado at boulder einstein s original sketches on this theory were recovered in august two zero zero five in the library of leiden university einstein also assisted erwin schr dinger in the development of the quantum boltzmann distribution a mixed classical and quantum mechanical gas model although he realized that this was less significant than the bose einstein model and declined to have his name included on the paper the einstein refrigerator einstein and szil rd s refrigerator patent diagram einstein and former student le szil rd co invented a unique type of refrigerator usually called the einstein refrigerator in one nine two six on november one one one nine three zero was awarded to albert einstein and le szil rd the patent covered a thermodynamic refrigeration cycle providing cooling with no moving parts at a constant pressure with only heat as an input the refrigeration cycle used ammonia butane and water world war ii when adolf hitler came to power in january one nine three three einstein was a guest professor at princeton university a position which he took in december one nine three two after a invitation from the american educator abraham flexner in one nine three three the nazis passed the law of the restoration of the civil service which forced all jewish university professors out of their jobs and throughout the one nine three zero s a campaign to label einstein s work as jewish physics in contrast with german or aryan physics was led by nobel laureates philipp lenard and johannes stark with the assistance of the ss the deutsche physik supporters worked to publish pamplets and textbooks denigrating einstein s theories and attempted to politically blacklist german physicists who taught them notably werner heisenberg einstein renounced his german citizenship and stayed in the united states where he was given permanent residency he accepted a position at the newly founded institute for advanced study in princeton township new jersey he became an american citizen in one nine four zero though he still retained swiss citizenship in one nine three nine under the encouragement of szil rd einstein sent a letter to president franklin delano roosevelt urging the study of nuclear fission for military purposes under fears that the nazi government would be first to develop atomic weapons roosevelt started a small investigation into the matter which eventually became the massive manhattan project einstein himself did not work on the bomb project however the international rescue committee was founded one nine three three at the request of albert einstein to assist opponents of adolf hitler for more information see the section below on einstein s political views institute for advanced study his work at the institute for advanced study focused on the unification of the laws of physics which he referred to as the unified field theory he attempted to construct a model which would describe all of the fundamental forces as different manifestations of a single force this took the form of an attempt to unify the gravitational and electrodynamic forces his attempt was hindered because the strong and weak nuclear forces were not understood independently until around one nine seven zero fifteen years after einstein s death einstein s goal of unifying the laws of physics under a single model survives in the current drive for unification of the forces embodied most notably by string theory generalized theory einstein began to form a generalized theory of gravitation with the universal law of gravitation and the electromagnetic force in his first attempt to demonstrate the unification and simplification of the fundamental forces in one nine five zero he described his work in a scientific american article einstein was guided by a belief in a single statistical measure of variance for the entire set of physical laws einstein s generalized theory of gravitation is a universal mathematical approach to field theory he investigated reducing the different phenomena by the process of logic to something already known or evident einstein tried to unify gravity and electromagnetism in a way that also led to a new subtle understanding of quantum mechanics einstein postulated a four dimensional space time continuum expressed in axioms represented by five component vectors particles appear in his research as a limited region in space in which the field strength or the energy density are particularly high einstein treated subatomic particles as objects embedded in the unified field influencing it and existing as an essential constituent of the unified field but not of it einstein also investigated a natural generalization of symmetrical tensor fields treating the combination of two parts of the field as being a natural procedure of the total field and not the symmetrical and antisymmetrical parts separately he researched a way to delineate the equations and systems to be derived from a variational principle einstein became increasingly isolated in his research on a generalised theory of gravitation and was ultimately unsuccessful in his attempts in particular his pursuit of a unification of the fundamental forces ignored work in the physics community at large most notably the discovery of the strong nuclear force and weak nuclear force einstein s two story house white frame with front porch in greek revival style in princeton one one two mercer street final years in one nine four eight einstein served on the original committee which resulted in the founding of brandeis university a portrait of einstein was taken by yousuf karsh on february one one of that same year in one nine five two the israeli government proposed to einstein that he take the post of second president he declined the offer and remains the only united states citizen ever to be offered a position as a foreign head of state on march three zero one nine five three einstein released a revised unified field theory he died at one one five am in princeton hospital in princeton new jersey on april one eight one nine five five at the age of seven six from internal bleeding which was caused by the rupture of an aortic aneurism leaving the generalized theory of gravitation unsolved the only person present at his deathbed a hospital nurse said that just before his death he mumbled several words in german that she did not understand he was cremated without ceremony on the same day he died at trenton new jersey in accordance with his wishes his ashes were scattered at an undisclosed location an autopsy was performed on einstein by dr thomas stoltz harvey who removed and preserved his brain harvey found nothing unusual with his brain but in one nine nine nine further analysis by a team at mcmaster university revealed that his parietal operculum region was missing and to compensate his inferior parietal lobe was one five wider than normal the inferior parietal region is responsible for mathematical thought visuospatial cognition and imagery of movement einstein s brain also contained seven three more glial cells than the average brain personality albert einstein was much respected for his kind and friendly demeanor rooted in his pacifism he was modest about his abilities and had distinctive attitudes and fashions for example he minimized his wardrobe so that he would not need to waste time in deciding on what to wear he was captivatingly simple wearing mothy sweaters and sweatshirts and sans socks in his old age he occasionally had a playful sense of humor and enjoyed sailing and playing the violin he was also the stereotypical bumbling absent minded professor he was often forgetful of everyday items such as keys and would focus so intently on solving physics problems that he would often become oblivious to his surroundings in his later years his appearance inadvertently created or reflected another stereotype of scientist in the process the researcher with unruly white hair religious views although he was raised jewish he was not a believer in the religious aspect of judaism though he still considered himself a jew he simply admired the beauty of nature and the universe from a letter written in english dated march two four one nine five four einstein wrote it was of course a lie what you read about my religious convictions a lie which is being systematically repeated i do not believe in a personal god and i have never denied this but have expressed it clearly if something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it he also said in an essay reprinted in living philosophies vol one three one nine three one a knowledge of the existence of something we cannot penetrate our perceptions of the profoundest reason and the most radiant beauty which only in their most primitive forms are accessible to our minds it is this knowledge and this emotion that constitute true religiosity in this sense and this sense alone i am a deeply religious man the following is a response made to rabbi herbert goldstein of the international synagogue in new york which read i believe in spinoza s god who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists not in a god who concerns himself with the fates and actions of human beings after being pressed on his religious views by martin buber einstein exclaimed what we physicists strive for is just to draw his lines after him he also quoted once when i read the bhagavad gita i ask myself how god created the universe everything else seems superfluous summarizing his religious beliefs he once said my religion consists of a humble admiration of the illimitable superior spirit who reveals himself in the slight details we are able to perceive with our frail and feeble mind einstein was an honorary associate of the rationalist press association beginning in one nine three four and was an admirer of ethical culture political views einstein and solomon mikhoels the chairman of the soviet jewish anti fascist committee in one nine four three einstein considered himself a pacifist and humanitarian and in later years a committed democratic socialist he once said i believe gandhi s views were the most enlightened of all the political men of our time we should strive to do things in his spirit not to use violence for fighting for our cause but by non participation of anything you believe is evil einstein s views on other issues including socialism mccarthyism and racism were controversial in a one nine four nine article entitled why socialism albert einstein described the predatory phase of human development exemplified by a chaotic capitalist society as a source of evil to be overcome he disapproved of the totalitarian regimes in the soviet union and elsewhere and argued in favor of a democratic socialist system which would combine a planned economy with a deep respect for human rights einstein was a co founder of the liberal german democratic party and a member of the afl cio affiliated union the american federation of teachers einstein was very much involved in the civil rights movement he was a close friend of paul robeson for over two zero years einstein was a member of several civil rights groups including the princeton chapter of the naacp many of which were headed by paul robeson he served as co chair with paul robeson of the american crusade to end lynching when w e b dubois was frivolously charged with being a communist spy during the mccarthy era while he was in his eight zero s einstein volunteered as a character witness in the case the case was dismissed shortly after it was announced that he was to appear in that capacity einstein was quoted as saying that racism is america s greatest disease the u s fbi kept a one four two seven page file on his activities and recommended that he be barred from immigrating to the united states under the alien exclusion act alleging that einstein believes in advises advocates or teaches a doctrine which in a legal sense as held by the courts in other cases would allow anarchy to stalk in unmolested and result in government in name only among other charges they also alleged that einstein was a member sponsor or affiliated with thirty four communist fronts between one nine three seven one nine five four and also served as honorary chairman for three communist organizations it should be noted that many of the documents in the file were submitted to the fbi mainly by civilian political groups and not actually written by fbi officials in one nine three nine einstein signed a letter written by le szil rd to president roosevelt arguing that the united states should start funding research into the development of nuclear weapons einstein opposed tyrannical forms of government and for this reason and his jewish background opposed the nazi regime and fled germany shortly after it came to power at the same time einstein s anarchist nephew carl einstein who shared many of his views was fighting the fascists in the spanish civil war einstein initially favored construction of the atomic bomb in order to ensure that hitler did not do so first and even sent a letter to president roosevelt dated august two one nine three nine before world war ii broke out and probably written by le szil rd encouraging him to initiate a program to create a nuclear weapon roosevelt responded to this by setting up a committee for the investigation of using uranium as a weapon which in a few years was superseded by the manhattan project after the war though einstein lobbied for nuclear disarmament and a world government i do not know how the third world war will be fought but i can tell you what they will use in the fourth rocks einstein was a supporter of zionism he supported jewish settlement of the ancient seat of judaism and was active in the establishment of the hebrew university in jerusalem which published one nine three zero a volume titled about zionism speeches and lectures by professor albert einstein and to which einstein bequeathed his papers however he opposed nationalism and expressed skepticism about whether a jewish nation state was the best solution he may have imagined jews and arabs living peacefully in the same land in later life in one nine five two he was offered the post of second president of the newly created state of israel but declined the offer claiming that he lacked the necessary people skills einstein was disturbed by the violence taking place in the palestine after the second world war and expressed that he was disappointed with the jewish ultra nationalist organization irgun and stern gang nonetheless einstein remained deeply committed to the welfare of israel and the jewish people for the rest of his life einstein along with albert schweitzer and bertrand russell fought against nuclear tests and bombs as his last public act and just days before his death he signed the russell einstein manifesto which led to the pugwash conferences on science and world affairs his letter to russell read dear bertrand russell thank you for your letter of april five i am gladly willing to sign your excellent statement i also agree with your choice of the prospective signers with kind regards a einstein nationality german swiss or american einstein was born a german citizen at the age of seventeen on january two eight one eight nine six he was released from the german citizenship by his own request and with the approval of his father he remained stateless for five years on february two one one nine zero one he gained swiss citizenship which he never revoked einstein regained german citizenship in april one nine one four when he entered german civil service but due to the political situation and the persecution of jewish people in nazi germany he left civil service in march one nine three three and thus also lost the german citizenship on october one one nine four zero einstein became an american citizen he remained both an american and a swiss citizen until his death on april one eight one nine five five popularity and cultural impact einstein s popularity has led to widespread use of einstein in advertising and merchandising including the registration of albert einstein as a trademark the photo detail from the original of this humorous expression was taken during einstein s birthday on march one four one

as a model for depictions of eccentric scientists in works of fiction his own character and distinctive hairstyle suggest eccentricity or even lunacy and are widely copied or exaggerated time magazine writer frederic golden referred to einstein as a cartoonist s dream come true on einstein s seven two nd birthday in one nine five one the upi photographer arthur sasse was trying to coax him into

einstein field equation rather than being named after hilbert hilbert had carried out the last few mathematical steps to its discovery independently and almost simultaneously with einstein but einstein was responsible for essentially everything that preceded those steps the recognition that tidal gravity must be the same thing as a warpage of spacetime the vision that the law of warpage

sometimes ascribed to a regional bloc in either south asia or the middle east as it has cultural ethno linguistic and geographic links with most of its neighbors it is bordered by iran in the west pakistan in the south and east turkmenistan uzbekistan and tajikistan in the north and china to the east it has a population of three zero million people although this remains an estimate as no official census has been taken for decades afghanistan literally translates to land of the afghans but a plethora of other names have been applied to its general location in the past between the fall of the taliban after the u s invasion of afghanistan and the two zero zero three loya jirga afghanistan was referred to by the government of the united states as the transitional islamic state of afghanistan under its new constitution the country is now officially named the islamic republic of afghanistan origin and history of the name the name of afghanistan derives from word afghan the pushtuns appear to have begun using the term afghan as a name for themselves from the islamic period onwards according to w k frazier tyler m c gillet and several other scholars the word afghan first appears in history in the hudud al alam in nine eight two ad there are numerous views regarding the origin of name afghan most of them being purely speculative as can be seen below makhzan i afghni by nematullah written in one six one two ce traces the afghan or pakhtun origin from the super patriarch abraham down to one named king talut or saul it states that saul had a son irmia jeremia who had a son called afghana upon the death of king saul afghana was raised by david and was later promoted to the chief command of the army during the reign of king solomon the progeny of this afghana multiplied numerously and came to be called bani israel in the sixth century bce bakhtunnasar or nebuchadnezzar king of babul attacked judah and exiled the progeny of afghana to ghor located in the center of what is now afghanistan in course of time the exiled community came to be addressed as afghan after the name of their ancestor and the country got its name as afghanistan this traditional view has many historical discrepancies and is therefore not accepted by modern scholarship the last pleader for the bani israel hypothesis being mayor raverty the pathans one nine five eight olaf caroe another version of pushtun legend places afghana the professed eponymous ancestor of the afghans or pushtuns as a contemporary of muslim prophet mohammad on hearing about the new faith of islam qais from aryana travelled to medina to see the muslim prophet muhammad and returned to aryana as a muslim qais abdur rashid purportedly had many sons one of whom was afghana afghana in turn had four sons who set out to the east to establish their separate lineages the first son went to swat the second to lahore and india the third to multan and the last one to quetta this legend is one of many traditional tales amongst the pashtuns regarding their disparate origins again it was this legendary afghana who is stated to have given the pushtuns their current name it is notable that the afghan of this legend is separated from the afghana of solomon s times by at least one one centuries dr h w bellew in his book an enquiry into the ethnography of afghanistan believes that the name afghan derives from the latin term alban used by armenians as alvan or alwan which refers to mountaineers and in the case of transliterated armenian characters would be pronounced as aghvan or aghwan to the persians this would further be altered to aoghan avghan and afghan as a reference to the highlanders or mountaineers of the eastern iranian plateau some people hold that the name derives from abagan i e without god which term the persians are stated to have coined for the pushtuns to describe them as godless or non believers it is claimed that word abagan is antonym of the word bagan believer in god just as word apolitical is antonym of political in the english language there are also a few people who link afghan to an uzbek word avagan said to mean original still others believe that the name derives from sanskrit upa ganah said to mean allied tribes another etymological view is that the name afghan evidently derives from sanskrit ashvaka or ashvakan q v the assakenoi of arrian this view was propounded by j w mccrindle and is supported by numerous modern scholars including c lassen s martin bishop crooks w crooke j c vidyalnar m r singh p smith n l dey dr j l kamboj s kirpal singh and several others in sanskrit word ashva iranian aspa prakrit assa means horse and ashvaka prakrit assaka means horseman pre christian times knew the people of eastern afghanistan as ashvakas horsemen since they raised a fine breed of horses and had a reputation for providing expert cavalrymen the fifth century bce indian grammarian panini calls them ashvayana and ashvakayana classical writers use the respective equivalents aspasios or aspasii hippasii and assakenois or assaceni assacani asscenus the aspasios assakenois ashvakas cavalrymen is stated to be another name for the kambojas because of their equestrian characteristics see list of country name etymologies the last part of the name afghanistan originates from the persian word st n country or land the english word afghanland that appeared in various treaties between qajar persia and the united kingdom dealing with the eastern lands of the persian kingdom modern afghanistan was adopted by the afghans and became afghanistan before being called afghanistan the region had gone through several name changes in its long history of around five zero zero zero years one of the most ancient names according to historians and scholars was ariana the greek pronunciation of the ancient avestan aryanam vaeja or the sanskrit aryavarta land of the aryans today this old persian and avestan expression is preserved in the name iran and it is noted in the name of the afghan national airline ariana airlines the term ariana afghanistan is still popular amongst persian speakers in the country many centuries later afghanistan was part of greater khorasan and hence was recognized with the name khorasan along with regions centered around merv and neishabur which in pahlavi means the eastern land in persian dehkhoda p eight four five seven history afghanistan exists at a unique nexus point where numerous eurasian civilizations have interacted and often fought and was an important site of early historical activity through the ages the region today known as afghanistan has been invaded by a host of peoples including the aryans medes persians greeks mauryans kushans sassanians arabs turks british and soviets but rarely have these groups managed to exert complete control over the region on other occasions native afghan entities have invaded surrounding regions to form empires of their own buddhas of bamiyan dating back to one st century pre islamic afghanistan were the largest buddha statues in the world they were destroyed by the taliban in two zero zero one calling them us islamic photo by hadi zaheer between two zero zero zero and one two zero zero bce waves of indo european speaking aryans are thought to have flooded into modern day afghanistan setting up a nation that became known as ary n m x a ra or land of the aryans zoroastrianism is speculated to have possibly originated in afghanistan between one eight zero zero to eight zero zero bce ancient eastern iranian languages such as avestan may have been spoken in afghanistan around a similar time line with the rise of zoroastrianism around one zero zero zero bce or earlier the indo aryan vedic civilization may have arisen near the vicinity of the kabul valley of eastern afghanistan but this remains speculative as more viable theories based upon archaeological finds tend to support the emergence of the vedic civilization east of the indus and or ganges in what is today pakistan and india by the middle of the six th century bce the persian empire supplanted the medes and incorporated aryana within its boundaries and by three three zero bce alexander the great had invaded the region following alexander s brief occupation the hellenic successor states of the seleucids and bactrians controlled the area while the mauryans from india

afghanistan became the center of various important empires including the ghaznavid empire nine six two one one five one founded by a local turkic ruler from ghazni named yamin ul dawlah mahmud that expanded its suzerainty over a vast area from kurdistan to northern india this empire was replaced by the ghorid empire one one five one one two one nine founded by another local ruler this time of

what is today pakistan and northern india by one five two seven as the empire shifted eastward the safavids of persia challenged mughal rule while the two superpower empires of the day battled over the fate of afghanistan for decades with the persians acquiring the area by the mid one seven th century local ghilzai pashtun tribesmen lead by khan nashir successfully overthrew safavid rule and

of the turko iranian conqueror nadir shah one of his high ranking military officers ahmad shah abdali himself a pashtun tribesman of the abdali clan called for a loya jirga following nadir shah s assassination for which many implicate abdali in one seven four seven the afghans pashtuns came together at kandahar in one seven four seven and chose ahmad shah who changed his last name to durrani meaning pearl of pearls in persian to be king the afghanistan nation state as it is known today came into existence in one seven four seven as the durrani empire and expanded outward from traditional pashtun territories to include all of what is today afghanistan a portion of mashad in iran and all of pakistan and kashmir as well the durrani empire lasted for nearly a century until internecine conflict and wars with the persians and sikhs diminished their empire by the early one nine th century however the current borders of afghanistan would not be determined until the coming of the british during the one nine th century following the anglo afghan wars fought in one eight three nine one eight four two one eight seven eight one eight eight zero and lastly in one nine one nine afghanistan saw much of its territory and autonomy ceded to the united kingdom the united kingdom exercised a great deal of influence and it was not until king amanullah acceded to the throne in one

this would lead to strained relations between afghanistan and british india and later the new state of pakistan over what came to be known as the pashtunistan debate the historical rulers of afghanistan were part of the abdali tribe of the ethnic afghans whose name was changed to durrani upon the accession of ahmad shah they belonged to the saddozay segment of the popalzay clan or to the mohammadzay segment of the barakzay clan of the ethnic afghans the mohammadzay frequently furnished the sadozay kings with top counselors who served occasionally as regents and identified with the

result of mujahideen opposition forces trained by the united states pakistan and other foreign governments the soviets withdrew ten years later in one nine eight nine for more details see soviet war in afghanistan the soviet withdrawal was seen as an ideological victory in the us which ostensibly had backed the mujahideen in order to counter soviet influence in the vicinity of the oil rich persian gulf following the removal of the soviet forces in one nine eight nine the us and its allies lost interest in afghanistan and did little to help rebuild the war ravaged country the ussr continued to support the regime of dr najubullah formerly the head of the secret service khad until its downfall in one nine nine two however the absence of the soviet forces resulted in the downfall of the government as it steadily lost ground to the guerrilla forces as the vast majority of the elites and intellectuals had either been systematically eliminated by the communists or escaped to take refuge abroad a dangerous leadership vacuum came into existence fighting continued among the various mujahidin factions eventually giving rise to a state of warlordism the chaos and corruption that dominated post soviet afghanistan in turn spawned the rise of the taliban in response to the growing chaos the most serious fighting during this growing civil conflict occurred in one nine nine four

impoverished country being one of the world s poorest and least developed countries two thirds of the population lives on less than us two a day the economy has suffered greatly from the recent political and military unrest since the one nine seven nine eight zero soviet invasion and subsequent conflicts while severe drought added to the nation s difficulties in one nine nine eight two zero

administered by the world bank group priority areas for reconstruction include the rebuilding of education system health and sanitation facilities enhancement of administrative capacity the development of the agricultural sector and the rebuilding of road energy and telecommunication links according to a two zero zero four report by the asian development bank the present reconstruction effort is two pronged first it focuses on rebuilding critical physical infrastructure and second on building modern public sector institutions from the remnants of soviet style planning to ones that promote market led development fujimura two zero zero four b but macroeconomic planning and management at present is hampered by poor information weak service delivery systems and less than adequate law enforcement the country has been going through economic recovery since the taliban were overthrown in october two zero zero one however estimating afghanistan s economy is problematic as it is impossible to gather reliable statistics while it is going through a significant change period in all fronts with the added problem of less than ideal security situation the best estimate that can be relied upon is that of the central statistical office in two zero zero three from which the cia factbook seems to have drawn some data accordingly the country s estimated gross domestic product gdp was two one five billion in two zero zero three a two eight six growth over two zero zero two cia factbook two zero zero three among the two three two listed countries in the cia factbook afghanistan ranks one zero eight th in terms of gdp which means per capita income of eight zero zero a brief comparison shows that afghanistan is the poorest country among its neighbors pakistan with a gdp of three four seven billion in two zero zero three had a per capita purchasing power of two two zero zero and iran with its five one seven billion had seven seven zero zero in the north turkmenistan had a gdp of two seven six billion and a per capita income of five seven zero zero uzbekistan with its four eight billion had one eight zero zero and tajikistan despite a low gdp of only eight billion had a per capita income of one one zero zero per head the world bank estimates that afghanistan will remain in need of external financial help before it can stand on its own feet economically ironically afghanistan s gdp ranks approximately at the same level as jordan two five five bn and qatar one nine five bn however considering that those oil rich arab states have smaller populations jordan per capita income amounts to four five zero zero and qatar s to two three two zero zero one of the main drivers for the current economic recovery is the return of over two million refugees from neighbouring countries and the west who brought with them fresh energy entrepreneurship and wealth creating skills as well as much needed capital to start up small businesses what is also helping is the estimated two three billion in international assistance the partial recovery of the agricultural sector and the reestablishment of market institutions while the country s current account deficit is largely financed with the donor money only a small portion about one five is provided directly to the government budget the rest is provided to non budgetary expenditure and donor designated projects through the un system and ngos it needs to be mentioned that there are some as yet unconfirmed claims that most of this money is spent on the expenses of the un and other non governmental organizations as well as being funneled into illegitimate activities the government had a central budget of only three five zero million in two zero zero three and an estimated five five zero million in two zero zero four the country s foreign exchange reserves totals about five zero zero million revenue is mostly generated through customs as income and corporate tax bases are negligible inflation had been a major problem until two zero zero two however the depreciation of the afghani in two zero zero two after the introduction of the new notes which replaced one zero zero zero old afghani by one new afghani coupled with the relative stability compared to previous periods has helped prices to stabilize and even decrease between december two zero zero two and february two zero zero three reflecting the turnaround appreciation of the new afghani currency since then the index has indicated stability with a moderate increase toward late two zero zero three fujimura two zero zero four c the afghan government and international donors seem to remain committed to improving access to basic necessities infrastructure development education housing and economic reform the central government is also focusing on improved revenue collection and public sector expenditure discipline the rebuilding of the financial sector seems to have been so far successful money can now be transferred in and out of the country via official banking channels and according to accepted international norms a new law on private investment provides three seven year tax holidays to eligible companies and a four year exemption from exports tariffs and duties while these improvements will help rebuild a strong basis for the nation in the future for now the majority of the population continues to suffer from insufficient food clothing housing medical care and other problems exacerbated by military operations and political uncertainties the government is not strong enough to collect customs duties from all the provinces due to the power of the warlords fraud is widespread and corruption is rife within all afghan government organs and central authority is barely felt in the lawless south and south west the economist two zero zero five expanding poppy cultivation and a growing opium trade is another huge problem for the country the cia estimates that one third of the country s gdp comes from opium export although the asian development bank states a lower figure namely two five billion one two of the gdp at any rate this is not only one of kabul s most serious policy and law enforcement challenges but also one of the world s most serious problems the problem began with the soviet invasion in one nine seven nine eight zero as the government began to lose control of provinces warlordism flourished and with it opium production as regional commanders searched for ways to generate money to purchase weapons according to the un at this time the west was pursuing an arms length supporting strategy of the afghan freedom fighters or mujahidin the main purpose being to cripple the ussr slowly into withdrawal rather than a quick and decisive overthrow when the west abandoned afghanistan after its perceived victory over the soviet union as the red army was forced to withdraw in one nine eight nine a power vacuum was created various mujahidin factions started fighting against each other for power with the discontinuation of western support they resorted ever more to poppy cultivation to finance their military existence the regional mafia who were looking for a safe operational hub joined forces with the more fanatic sections of the mujahidin supported by arab extremists like osama bin laden as well as the pakistani secret intelligence service isi to form the taliban movement towards the end of one nine nine four rashid two zero zero zero see also bbc report here the taliban having taken control of nine zero of the country actively encouraged poppy cultivation with this they not only fulfilled their promises and obligations to their partners the regional mafia but also increased their own desperately needed income through taxes according to the above un source afghanistan saw a bumper opium crop of four six zero zero million tonnes in one nine nine nine which was the height of the taliban rule in afghanistan when they came under extreme international diplomatic pressure in two zero zero two they initiated a ban on poppy cultivation following the us led coalition war that led to the defeat of the taliban in november two zero zero one which essentially collapsed the economy the relatively few other sources of revenue forced many of the country s farmers to resort back to growing cash crops for export a notable example of such a crop is the opium poppy one three zero zero km in two zero zero four according to the united nations office on drugs and crime the cultivation of which has largely increased during the last decade afghanistan has become the first illicit opium producer in the world before burma myanmar part of the so called golden triangle the main obstacle to eradicating poppy cultivation in afghanistan is the us forces need for the warlords and their forces in hunting terrorists the warlords are the major culprits in poppy cultivation but are also highly useful to the us forces in scouting providing local intelligence keeping their own territories clean from al qaeda and taliban insurgents and even taking part in military operations all for money this also contributes to the lack of central government s real authority in provinces and discourages farmers from growing grain and fruit as they did for centuries previously in short the afghan economy is currently december two zero zero five going through a hefty change period on the one hand there are encouraging signs of positive development and increasing wealth creation and management but on the other hand the security situation the lingering war against terrorism and the opium problem have created tall barriers for afghanistan to rejoin the international community in prosperity and economic development economy references

albania this process was completed over the second millennium bc and did not really affect northern or central albania an area that at the time presented the image of a political vacuum in essence a historical paradox historians do not agree over the origin of the illyrians some of them maintain that the illyrians descended from the pre indo european pelasgians while most scholars place them in the later wave of indo european invasions their presence can be traced back to nine zero zero bc when their political structure was formulated in the seven th and six th centuries bc excellent metal craftsmen and fierce warriors the illyrians formed warlord based kingdoms that fought amongst themselves for most of their history only during the six th century did the illyrians venture significant raids against their immediate neighbours the kingdom of the molossians in southern albania the kingdom of macedon and the kingdom of paionia besides warfare the illyrians were also peaceful traders of agricultural products and metal works the illyrian culture was heavily influenced by the greek culture mainly the south illyrian tribes albania is also the site of several ancient greek colonies macedonian rule probably their most important success was the slaughter of perdiccas iii king of macedon unfortunately for the illyrians perdiccas was succeeded by philip ii father of alexander the great who effectively terminated the illyrian aggression effectively ending any dominant control by the illyrians in the region roman and byzantine rule after being conquered by the roman empire illyria was reorganized as a roman province illyricum later divided into the provinces of dalmatia and pannonia the lands comprising albania mostly being included in dalmatia later the byzantine empire governed the region it was also ruled by the bulgarian and serbian empire after centuries use of the name illyria to denote the region fell out of fashion ottoman rule in the middle ages the

kastrioti skenderbeu led a successful resistance against the invading ottomans after the death of skenderbeg resistance continued until one four seven eight although with only moderate success the loyalties and alliances created and nurtured by skenderbeg faltered and fell apart and the ottomans conquered the territory of albania shortly after the fall of the castle kruje albania then became part of the ottoman empire following this many albanians fled to neighboring italy and the majority of the albanian population that remained converted to islam they would remain a part of the ottoman empire until one nine one two effects of the balkan wars after the second balkan war the ottomans were removed from albania and there was a possibility of the lands being absorbed by serbia and the southern tip by greece this decision angered the italians who did not want serbia to have an extended coastline and it angered the germans who could build a railway to reach the orient berlin then held discussions with russia the superpower in charge of serbia and with greece eventually it was decided that the country should not be divided but instead consolidated into the principality of albania under a german prince william of wied when the german prince was expelled by the albanian people after six months as the self named king of albania great britain france and italy as members

often used to refer specifically to the islamic concept of god see usage below etymology usage although outside the arab world use of the word all h is most often associated with islam it is not exclusive to that faith arab christians and various arabic speaking jews including the teimanim several communities and some sephardim also use it to refer to the monotheist deity arabic translations of the bible also employ it as do roman catholics in malta who pronounce it as alla christians in indonesia who say allah bapa god the father and christians in the middle east who use the aramaic all ha allah as a word many linguists believe that the term all h is derived from a contraction of the arabic words al the and il h deity masculine form al il h meaning the god in addition one of the main pagan goddesses of pre islamic arabia all t al il h at or the goddess is cited as being etymologically though not synchronically the feminine linguistic counterpart to the grammatically masculine all h if so the word all h is an abbreviated title meaning the deity rather than a name for this reason both muslim and non muslim scholars often translate all h directly into english as god this also explains why arabic speaking jews and christians freely refer to god as all h however some muslim scholars feel that all h should not be translated because they perceived the arabic word to express the uniqueness of all h more accurately than the word god which can take a plural gods whereas the word all h has no plural form this is a significant issue in translation of the qur an all h written in simple arabic calligraphy the word all h is always written without an alif to spell the vowel this is because the spelling was settled before arabic spelling started habitually using alif to spell however in vocalized spelling a diacritic alif is added on top of the shaddah to indicate pronunciation one exception is in the pre islamic zabad inscription where it is spelled unicode has glyph reserved for allah u fdf two which can be combined with an alif to yield the post consonantal form as opposed to the full spelling alif l m l m h which may be rendered slightly differently in particular featuring a diacritic alif on top of the shadda in this unicode imitates traditional arabic typesetting which also frequently featured special ll h types also in abjad numerals the name of allah numeric value is six six islamic use of all h from the point of view of traditional islamic theology all h is the most precious name of god because it is not a descriptive name like other ninety nine names of god but the name of god s own presence muslims believe that the name of allah had existed before the time of adam it is the same god worshipped by adam noah abraham moses jesus muhammad and other prophets of islam in islam there is only one god and muhammad is the last messenger the emphasis in islamic culture on reciting the qur an in arabic has resulted in all h often being used by muslims world wide as the word for god regardless of their native language out of one one four suras in the qur an one one three begin with the basmala bismi ll hi r rahm ni r rah m which means in the name of god the most kind the most merciful muslims when referring to the name often add the words subhanahu wa ta ala after it meaning glorified and exalted is he as a sign of reverence or azza wa jalla the entire religion of islam is based on the idea of getting closer to god although commonly referred to as a he god is considered genderless but there is no neuter gender to express this in the arabic language when greek or other polytheistic deities are discussed in arabic it is customary to use the expression il h a deity or lower case god sometimes the word ma b d literally meaning worshipped entity is used instead uses of all h in phrases there are many phrases that contain the word all h all hu akbar god is the greatest a uzu billahi minashaitanir rajim i seek refuge in allah from shaitan the damned bismi ll h in the name of god insh all h god willing also the origin of the common spanish interjection ojal which shares a similar meaning probably also the origin of the portuguese interjection oxal let s hope for it or let s hope that y all h oh god may be the origin of the spanish and portuguese exclamation ol m sh all h look at what god has willed subh n all h glory be to god al hamdu li ll h all praise be to god all hu a alam god knows best jazaka all hu khayran may god reward you for your deeds all h appears in a stylized form on the flag of iran in the phrase all hu akbar on the flag of iraq and as part of the shah dah on the flag of saudi arabia allah is not correctly used as a man s name see arabic name mistakes made by europeans and other non arabs islamic concept of god the islamic concept of mankind s place in the universe hinges on the notion that all h or god is the only true reality there is nothing permanent other than him god is considered eternal and uncreated whereas everything else in the universe is created the qur an describes him in sura one one two say he is all h singular all h the absolute he begetteth not nor was begotten and to him have never been one equal see tawhid for more the qur an condemns and mocks the pre islamic arabs for attributing daughters to all h sura five three one nine muslims believe that all h or god is the only true god who deserves to be worshipped this belief must be accompanied by the acknowledgement that mohammad was a true prophet of god who was chosen to guide people to believing and worshipping god in the correct manner god is considered eternal and uncreated with no beginning whereas everything else in the universe is created with a beginning the qur an mentions approximated in english sura one one two say he is all h without partner all h the absolute he begetteth not nor was begotten and to him have never been one equal see tawhid for more god is considered by muslims to be omnipotent omnipresent and omniscient in the qur an god is described as being fully aware of everything that happens in the universe and knows all things god also knows what is in people s hearts and minds at all times it is mentioned in the qur an approximately and he it is who takes your souls at night in sleep and he knows what you acquire in the day then he raises you up therein that an appointed term may be fulfilled then to him is your return then he will inform you of what you were doing sura six six zero placing god inside his creation or suggesting that nature or creation simultaneously co exist in god or vice versa as in other religious traditions completely compromises exclusive islamic monotheism attributing a partner spouse father son daughter mother or other relation s to allah literally or metaphorically partially or completely is considered unquestionably blasphemous by muslims therefore muslims consider it blasphemous to describe jesus or another man woman child etc as son of god whether literally or metaphorically similarly muslims do not believe that god resembles a man old or young woman half man half woman half man half animal bird elephant or other animal or other creation it is forbidden for muslims to view god anthropomorphically allah does not resemble any of his creations in any way whatsoever allah is not attributed with shape colour size position location direction and indeed all of these attributes are found in the creatures allah created further muslims do not believe that allah is located in a place whether on earth below the earth in the sky above the sky on a throne above the sky or all of these places at once or anywhere else or everywhere but rather god exists without a place given he created all places and locations and the perfectness of his existence is not compromised by his existence not being bound to a created by allah place or location god is attributed with complete perfection in his attributes and is free from any defects or any imperfections allah is attributed amongst other attributes with oneness without a partner in god s self or attributes non beginningness eternalness complete freedom from needing others i e each or any of his creations complete power to do all things will to do as he wills as and when god decides without any obstruction knowledge of all things simultaneously past present and future hearing of all sounds without needing any implement or organ to hear sight without needing eyes or any other organ or instrument nor light rays to illuminate an area or an object life unlike the human or other life which is created and limited but that which befits him with no beginning or end speech unlike the human created speech which is constituted of languages letters and sounds but rather an eternal speech which is not a creation but an attribute of god and the complete non resemblence of any creation in his self or attributes history it was used in pre islamic times by pagans within the arabian peninsula to signify the supreme creator pre islamic jews referred to their supreme creator as yahweh or elohim the pagan arabs recognized all h as the supreme god in their pantheon along with allah however the pre islamic arabs believed in a host of other gods such as hubal and daughters of all h the three daughters associated were al l t al uzzah and manah encyclopedia of world mythology and legend the facts on file ed anthony mercatante new york one nine eight three i six one this view of allah by the pre islamic pagans is viewed by muslims as a latter development having arisen as a result of moving away from abrahamic monotheism over time some of the names of these pagan gods are said to be derived from the descendants of noah whom latter generations firstly revered as saints and then transformed into gods although non muslims often view polytheism as having come before monotheism the pagan arabians also used the word all h in the names of their children muhammad s father who was born into pagan society was named abdull h which translates servant of all h abdull h is still used for names of muslim and non muslim arabs the hebrew word for deity el or el ah was used as an old testament synonym for yahweh which is the proper name for the jewish god according to the tanakh the aramaic word for god is al h syriac dialect or el h biblical dialect which comes from the same proto semitic word il h as the arabic and hebrew terms jesus is described in mark one five three four as having used the word on the cross with the ending meaning my when saying my god my god why hast thou forsaken me transliterated in greek as el i one of the earliest surviving translations of the word into a foreign language is in a greek translation of the shahada from eight six nine six ah seven zero five seven one five ad which translates it as ho theos monos literally the one god also the cognate aramaic term appears in the aramaic version of the new testament called the pshitta or peshitta as one of the words jesus used to refer to god e g in the sixth beatitude blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see al ha and in the arabic bible the same words mt five eight other beliefs the nation of gods and earths one of the many sects created as the result of black separatist movements in the united states holds that the word all h is the name of the original black man and stands for arm leg leg arm head this concept is alien to mainstream islam which strictly opposes any attempt to portray all h as a human or in any other way mainstream islam also prohibits attibuting divine qualities to worshipping or glorifying anything other than all h the bah faith whose are primarily written in arabic and farsi also uses allah to mean god though in practice the customary word for god in the local language is typically used when speaking in that language some particular uses are not translated but the arabic phrase is

antarctica the continent of antarctica is located mostly south of the antarctic circle surrounded by the southern ocean antarctica is the southernmost land mass on earth comprising more than one four million km making it the five th largest continent the coastline measures one seven nine six eight km physically antarctica is divided in two by the transantarctic mountains close to the neck between the ross sea and the weddell sea the portion of the continent west of the weddell sea and east of the ross sea is called western antarctica and the remainder eastern antarctica because they correspond roughly to the eastern and western hemispheres relative to the greenwich meridian western antarctica is covered by the west antarctic ice sheet about nine eight percent of antarctica is covered by an ice sheet that is on average two five kilometers thick vinson massif the highest peak in antarctica at four eight nine two meters is located in the ellsworth mountains the west antarctic ice sheet has been of recent concern because of the slight possibility of its collapse if it does break down ocean levels would rise by a few meters in a relatively short period of time despite its zero rainfall in some areas the continent has approximately nine zero of the world s fresh water in the form of ice mt erebus an active volcano in ross island although antarctica is home to many volcanoes only deception island and mt erebus are active mount erebus located in ross island is the southernmost active volcano on earth minor eruptions are frequent and lava flow has been observed in recent years other dormant volcanoes may potentially be active in two zero zero four an underwater volcano was found in the antarctic peninsula by american and canadian researchers recent evidence shows this unnamed volcano may be active antarctica is home to more than seven zero lakes that lie thousands of metres under the surface of the continental ice sheet including one under the south pole itself lake vostok discovered beneath russia s vostok station in one nine nine six is the largest of these subglacial lakes it is believed that the lake has been sealed off for three five million years there is some evidence that vostok s waters may contain microbial life due to the lake s similarity to europa a moon of jupiter confirming that life can survive in lake vostok might strengthen the argument

a marsupial fauna but by about four five mya australia new guinea had separated from antarctica and the first ice appeared at around two five mya due to the opening of the drake passage between antarctica and south america and the resulting antarctic circumpolar current the ice spread quickly displacing the forests that then covered the continent since about one five mya the continent has been mostly covered with ice climate the blue ice covering lake fryxell in the transantarctic mountains comes from glacial meltwater from the canada glacier and other smaller glaciers antarctica is the coldest place on earth antarctica has little rainfall with the south pole getting none making it a continental desert temperatures reach a minimum of between eight five and nine zero degrees celsius one two one and one three zero degrees fahrenheit in the winter and about three zero degrees higher in the summer months sunburn is often a health issue as the snow surface reflects over nine zero of the sunlight falling on it eastern antarctica is colder than its western counterpart because of its higher elevation weather fronts rarely penetrate far into the continent leaving the center cold and dry there is little precipitation over the central portion of the continent but ice there can last for extended time periods however heavy snowfalls are not uncommon on the coastal portion of the continent where snowfalls of up to one two two meters four eight inches in four eight hours have been recorded at the edge of the continent strong katabatic winds off the polar plateau often blow at storm force in the interior however wind speeds are often moderate during summer more solar radiation reaches the surface at the south pole than is received at the equator in an equivalent period depending on the latitude long periods of constant darkness or constant sunlight mean that climates familiar to humans are not generally available on the continent the aurora australis commonly known as the southern lights is a glow observed in the night sky near the south pole another unique spectacle is diamond dust diamond dust refers to a ground level cloud composed of tiny ice crystals

flora more than two zero zero species of lichens are known in antarctica the climate of antarctica does not allow for much vegetation to exist a combination of freezing temperatures soil quality lack of moisture and sunlight limit the chances for plants to exist as a result plant life is limited to mostly mosses and liverworts the autotrophic community is made up of mostly protists the flora of the continent largely consists of lichens bryophytes algae and fungi growth generally occurs in the summer and only for a few weeks at most there are more than two zero zero species of lichens and approximately five zero species of bryophytes such as mosses seven hundred species of algae exist most of which are phytoplankton multicolored snow algae and diatoms are especially abundant in the coastal regions during the summer there are two species of flowering plants found in the antarctic peninsula antarctic hair grass and antarctic pearlwort fauna emperor penguins in ross sea antarctica land fauna is completely invertebrate such invertebrate life includes microscopic mites lice and springtails the midge just one two mm in size is the largest land animal in antarctica other than man the snow petrel is one of only three birds that breed exclusively in antarctica and have been seen at the south pole a variety of marine animals exist and they rely directly or indirectly on the phytoplankton antarctic sea life includes penguins blue whales and fur seals more specifically the emperor penguin is the only penguin that breeds during the winter in antarctica the ad lie penguin breeds further south than any penguin the rockhopper penguin has distinctive feathers around the eyes one could call them elaborate eyelashes king penguins are also predominant in the antarctic the antarctic fur seal was very heavily hunted in the one eight th and one nine th centuries for its pelt by sealers from the united states and the united kingdom antarctic krill which congregate in large schools is the keystone species of the ecosystem of the southern ocean and is an important food organism for whales seals leopard seals fur seals squid icefish penguins albatrosses and many other birds the approval of the antarctic conservation act brought several restrictions to the continent the introduction of alien plants or animals can bring a criminal penalty as can the extraction of any indigenous species the overfishing of krill which plays a large role in the antarctic ecosystem led officials to enact regulations on fishing the convention for the conservation of antarctic marine

through most of the one nine nine zero s the menem and de la r a administrations faced diminished competitiveness of exports massive imports which damaged national industry and reduced employment chronic fiscal and trade deficits and the contagion of several economic crises the asian financial crisis in one nine nine eight precipitated an outflow of capital that mushroomed into a recession which led to a total freezing of the bank accounts the corralito and culminated in a financial panic in november two zero zero one the next month amidst bloody riots president de la r a resigned

argentina is divided into two three provinces provincias singular provincia and one autonomous city commonly known as capital federal marked with an asterisk the current official name for the federal district is ciudad aut noma de buenos aires buenos aires has been the capital of argentina since its unification but there have been projects to move the administrative centre elsewhere during the presidency of ra l alfons n a law was passed ordering the move of the federal capital to viedma a city in the patagonic province of r o negro studies were underway when hyperinflation in one nine eight nine killed off the project though the law was never formally repealed it has become a mere historical relic and the project has been forgotten urbanization government house of tucum n about two seven million people live in the autonomous city of buenos aires and roughly one one five million in greater buenos aires two zero zero one making it one of the largest urban conglomerates in the world together with their respective metropolitan areas the second and third largest cities in argentina c rdoba and rosario comprise about one three and one one million inhabitants respectively most european immigrants to argentina coming in great waves especially around the world war i and ii settled in the cities which offered jobs education and other opportunities that enabled newcomers to enter the middle class since the one nine three zero s many rural workers have moved to the big cities the one nine nine zero s saw many rural towns become ghost towns when train services were abandoned and local products manufactured on a small scale were replaced by massive amounts of imported cheap goods in part because of the monetary policy which kept the u s dollar exchange rate fixed and low many slums villas miseria sprouted in the outskirts of the largest cities inhabited by empoverished low class urban dwellers and migrants from smaller towns in the interior of the country however it is important to note that the majority of the people that live in these newly formed small shanty towns are people that came from neighboring countries during the time of convertibility and never left this immigration of humble people from a low socioeconomic status represented an undesirable change because shanty towns and homeless people begging for money was something argentines didn t know until the economic disaster of the one nine nine zero s however the government works actively to try to include these new inmigrants into argentine society and considers their children born in argentina to be argentines there are no plans to build any type of wall to keep these inmigrants out argentina adheres to a policy of allowing anybody who wants to come to argentina to come freely without restrictive inmigration measures in this respect argentina is more progressive than many fully developed countries argentina s urban areas have a european look reflecting the influence of their european settlers many towns and cities are built like spanish cities around a main square called a plaza a cathedral and important government buildings often face the plaza the general layout of the cities is called a damero that is a checkerboard since it is based on a pattern of square blocks though modern developments sometimes depart from it for example the city of la plata built at the end of the one nine th century is organised as a checkerboard plus diagonal avenues at fixed intervals in descending order by number of inhabitants the major cities in argentina are buenos aires c rdoba rosario mendoza la plata tucum n mar del plata salta santa fe and bah a blanca geography map of argentina argentina can roughly be divided into three parts the fertile plains of the pampas in the central part of the country the centre of argentina s agricultural wealth the flat to rolling plateau of patagonia in the southern half down to tierra del fuego and the rugged andes mountain range along the western border with chile with the highest point being the cerro aconcagua at six nine six zero metres two two eight three four ft major rivers include the paraguay bermejo colorado uruguay and the largest river the paran the latter two flow together before meeting the atlantic ocean forming the estuary of the r o de la plata the argentine climate is predominantly temperate with extremes ranging from subtropical in the north to arid sub antarctic in far south enclaves and exclaves there is one argentine exclave the island of mart n garc a co ordinates it is situated near the confluence of the paran and uruguay rivers a mere kilometre zero six two mi inside uruguayan waters about three five kilometres two one mi from the uruguayan coastline near the small city of mart n chico itself about halfway between nueva palmira and colonia del sacramento an agreement reached by argentina and uruguay in one nine seven three reaffirmed argentine jurisdiction over the island ending a century old dispute between the two countries according to the terms of the agreement mart n garc a is to be devoted exclusively to a natural preserve its area is about two square kilometres five zero zero acres and the population about two zero zero people economy subway station in monserrat buenos aires argentina benefits from rich natural resources a highly literate population an export oriented agricultural sector and a diversified industrial base the country historically had a large middle class compared to other latin american countries but this segment of the population was decimated by a succession of economic crises today while a significant segment of the population is still financially well off they stay in sharp contrast with millions who live in poverty or on the brink of it since the late one nine seven zero s the country piled up public debt and was plagued by bouts of high inflation in one nine nine one the government pegged the peso to the u s dollar and limited the growth in the monetary base the government then embarked on a path of trade liberalisation deregulation and privatisation inflation dropped and gdp grew but external economic shocks and failures of the system diluted its benefits causing it to crumble in slow motion from one nine nine five and up to the collapse in two zero zero one by two zero zero two argentina had defaulted on its debt its gdp had shrunk unemployment was over two five the peso had devalued seven five after being floated and inflation was hitting again however careful spending control and heavy taxes on now soaring exports gave the state the tools to regain resources and conduct monetary policy in two zero zero three import substitution policies and soaring exports coupled with a lower inflation and expansive economic measures triggered a surge in the gdp which was repeated in two zero zero four creating jobs and encouraging internal consumption capital flight decreased and foreign investment slowly returned the influx of foreign currency from exports created such a huge trade surplus that the central bank was forced to buy dollars from the market which it continues to do at the time to be accumulated as reserves the situation in two zero zero five is much improved but there are still large numbers of unemployed people that beg for some money or food especially in the outskirts of buenos aires some of them are homeless and there is at least one small non profit humanitarian organisation which distributes free food to some of them most days of the week however the country is still the most developed country in latin america it boasts the highest gdp per capita the highest levels of education measured by university attendance and a reasonable infrastructure that in many aspects is equal in quality to that found in fully industrialized nations in two zero zero two over five seven of the population was below the poverty line at the end of two zero zero five it was three four in two zero zero two unemployement had reached over two five and now it is one zero gdp per capita has surpassed the previous pre recession peek of one nine nine eight it is a very interesting time in argentina because the experts agree that if the country makes the right decisions it could develop and reclaim its previosly held position in the first world so far things are looking good the economy grew eight eight in two zero zero three nine zero in two zero zero four and nine one in two zero zero five the floor is set so that the economy will grow between six zero and seven five in two zero zero six and the government is paying down the foreign debt foreign debt now stands at six nine of gdp and is slowly decreasing the argentine economy has so much untapped potential that if the country manages to encourage the proper level of investment the country could experience growth rates of nine zero for this year and years to come demographics night shot of the colon theatre in buenos aires argentina unlike most of its neighbouring countries argentina s population descends overwhelmingly from europeans the basic demographic stock nine seven of the population is made up of descendants of spanish italian german and other european settlers waves of immigrants from european countries arrived in the late one nine th and early two zero th centuries the patagonian chubut valley has a significant welsh descended population and retains many aspects of welsh culture other important immigrant groups came from germany german colonies were settled in the

united kingdom and ireland buenos aires and patagonia and eastern european nations such as poland russia ukraine and the balkans region especially croatia and serbia and others the overwhelming

community in latin america and fifth largest in the world middle eastern immigrants number about five zero zero zero zero zero mainly in urban areas small numbers of people from far east asia have also settled argentina mainly in buenos aires the first asian argentines were of japanese descent but koreans vietnamese and chinese soon followed there are also smaller numbers of people from the indian subcontinent culture european and modern styles in buenos aires argentine culture has been primarily informed and influenced by its european roots buenos aires is undeniably the most european city in south america due both to the prevalence of people of italian spanish and german descent and to conscious imitation argentine cinema has achieved international recognition with films such as the official story and nine queens though it has only rarely been taken into account by mainstream popular viewers who prefer hollywood type movies even low budget productions however have obtained prizes in cinema festivals such as cannes the city of mar del plata organizes its own festival dedicated to this art the best known element of argentine culture is probably their music and dance particularly tango in modern argentina tango music is enjoyed in its own right especially since the radical astor piazzolla redefined the music of carlos gardel it must be noted that while tango refers mostly to a particular dancing music for foreigners the music together with the lyrics often sung in a kind of slang called lunfardo are what most argentines primarily mean by tango tango lyrics can be considered a kind of poetry since the one nine seven zero s rock and roll is also widely appreciated in argentina first during the one nine seven zero s and then again at the mid one nine eight zero s and the beginning of the one nine nine zero s national rock and roll and pop music experienced bursts of popularity with many new bands such as soda stereo and sumo and composers like charly garc a and fito p ez becoming important referents of national culture buenos aires is also considered the techno electronica country in latin america that started with little raves and nowadays is home of important events such as creamfields which has the world record of six five zero zero zero people south american music conference and many more european classical music is well

a member of the council of europe and the commonwealth of independent states and for centuries has been on the crossroads between the east and west origin of the name the original armenian name for the country was hayq later hayastan translated as the land of haik and consisting of the name haik and the persian suffix stan land according to legend haik was a great great grandson of noah son of togarmah who was a son of gomer a son of noah s son japheth and according to an ancient armenian tradition a forefather of all armenians he is said to have settled below mount ararat travelled to assist in building the tower of babel and after his return defeated the babylonian king bel believed by some researchers to be nimrod on august one one two four nine two bc near lake van in the southern part of historic armenia presently in turkey hayq was given the name armenia by the surrounding states as it was the name of the strongest tribe living in the historic armenian lands who called themselves armens it is traditionally derived from armenak or aram the great grandson of haik s great grandson and another leader who is according to armenian tradition the ancestor of all armenians some jewish and christian scholars write that the name armenia was derived from har minni that is mountains of minni or mannai pre christian accounts suggest that nairi meaning land of rivers was an ancient name for the country s mountainous region first used by assyrians around one two zero zero bc while the first recorded inscription bearing the name armenia namely the behistun inscription in iran dates from five two one bc history armenia has been populated by humans since prehistoric times and has been proposed as the site of the biblical garden of eden armenia was a regional empire with a rich culture in the years leading up to the one st century spanning from the shores of the black sea to the caspian sea and the mediterranean sea during the rule of tigranes the great armenia s strategic location between two continents has subjected it to invasions by many peoples including the assyrians persians greeks romans byzantines arabs turks and mongols in ad three zero one armenia became the first country in the world to adopt christianity as its official state religion twelve years before the roman empire granted christianity official toleration under galerius and some three zero four zero years before constantine was baptised there had been various pagan communities before christianity but they were converted by an influx of christian missionaries having changed between various dynasties including parthian iranian roman byzantine arab mongol and persian occupations armenia was substantially weakened in one five zero zero s the ottoman empire and safavid persia divided armenia among themselves in one eight one three and one eight two eight present day armenia consisting of the erivan and karabakh khanates within persia was temporarily incorporated into the russian empire after a short lived independent republic established after the bolshevik revolution in petrograd armenia was incorporated into the ussr between one nine two two and one nine three six it existed as the transcaucasian soviet federated socialist republic with georgia armenia and azerbaijan and from one nine three six to one nine nine one as the armenian ssr during the final years of the ottoman empire one nine one five one nine two two a large proportion of armenians living in anatolia perished as a result of what is termed the armenian genocide regarded by armenians and the vast majority of western historians to have been state sponsored mass killings turkish authorities however maintain that the deaths were a result of a civil war coupled with disease and famine with casualties incurred by both sides most estimates for the number of armenians killed range from six five zero zero zero zero to one five zero zero zero zero zero and these events are traditionally commemorated yearly on april two four armenians and a handful of other countries worldwide have been campaigning for official recognition of the events as genocide for over three zero years but there are also many countries who are pressured not to officially characterize the armenian massacres as genocide armenia remained preoccupied by a long conflict with azerbaijan over nagorno karabakh a mostly armenian populated enclave that armenians allege stalin had placed in soviet azerbaijan a military conflict between armenia and azerbaijan began in one nine eight eight and the fighting escalated after both countries gained independence from the soviet union in one nine nine one by may one nine nine four when a cease fire took hold armenian forces controlled not only nagorno karabakh but also the surrounding districts of azerbaijan proper the economies of both countries have been hurt in the absence of a peaceful resolution politics the government of armenia s stated aim is to build a western style parliamentary democracy as the basis of its form of government however international observers have questioned the fairness of armenia s parliamentary and presidential elections and constitutional referenda since one nine nine five citing polling deficiencies lack of cooperation by the electoral commission and poor maintenance of electoral lists and polling places for the most part however armenia is considered one of the more pro democratic nations in the commonwealth of independent states the unicameral parliament also called the national assembly is controlled by a coalition of three political parties the conservative republican party the armenian revolutionary federation and the country of law party the main opposition is composed of several smaller parties joined in the justice bloc armenians voted overwhelmingly for independence in a september one nine nine one referendum levon ter petrossian was president until january one nine nine eight when public demonstrations against his increasingly authoritarian regime and his domestic and foreign policies forced his resignation in one nine nine nine as the prime minister vazgen sargsian parliament speaker karen demirchian and six other officials were killed in the attack on the national assembly the country experienced a period of political instability president robert

no point is below four zero zero metres one three one two ft above sea level mount ararat regarded by the armenians as a symbol of their land is the highest mountain in the region and used to be part of armenia until around one nine one five when it fell to the turks armenia is trying to address its environmental problems it has established a ministry of nature protection and introduced taxes for air and water pollution and solid waste disposal whose revenues are used for environmental protection activities armenia is interested in cooperating with other members of the commonwealth of independent states cis a group of one two former soviet republics and with members of the international community on environmental issues the armenian government is working toward closing its nuclear power plant at medzamor near yerevan as soon as alternative energy sources are identified economy until independence armenia s economy was largely industry based chemicals electronics machinery processed food synthetic rubber and textile and highly dependent on outside resources agriculture contributed only two zero of net material product and one zero of employment before the breakup of the soviet union in one nine nine one armenian mines produce copper zinc gold and lead the vast majority of energy is produced with fuel imported from russia including gas and nuclear fuel for its one nuclear power plant the main domestic energy source is hydroelectric small amounts of coal gas and petroleum have not yet been developed like other newly independent states of the former soviet union armenia s economy suffers from the legacy of a centrally planned economy and the breakdown of former soviet trading patterns soviet investment in and support of armenian industry has virtually disappeared so that few major enterprises are still able to function in addition the effects of the one nine eight eight spitak earthquake which killed more than two five zero zero zero people and made five zero zero zero zero zero homeless are still being felt the conflict with azerbaijan over nagorno karabakh has not been resolved the closure of azerbaijani and turkish borders has devastated the economy because armenia depends on outside supplies of energy and most raw materials land routes through georgia and iran are inadequate or unreliable gdp fell nearly six zero from one nine eight nine until one nine nine two one nine nine three the national currency the dram suffered hyperinflation for the first years after its introduction in one nine nine three nevertheless the government was able to make wide ranging economic reforms that paid off in dramatically lower inflation and steady growth the one nine nine four cease fire in the nagorno karabakh conflict has also helped the economy armenia has had strong economic growth since one nine nine five building on the turnaround that began the previous year and inflation has been negligible for the past several years new sectors such as precious stone processing and jewelry making information and communication technology and even tourism are beginning to supplement more traditional sectors in the economy such as agriculture this steady economic progress has earned armenia increasing support from international institutions the international monetary fund imf world bank european bank for reconstruction and development ebrd and other international financial institutions ifis and foreign countries are extending considerable grants and loans loans to armenia since one nine nine three exceed one one billion these loans are targeted at reducing the budget deficit stabilizing the currency developing private businesses energy the agriculture food processing transportation and health and education sectors and ongoing

one a majority of the population are shi a muslim and of western turkic descent known as azerbaijanis or simply azeris the country is formally an emerging democracy however with strong authoritarian rule etymology there are several hypotheses regarding the origins of the name azerbaijan the most common theory is that it is derived from atropatan atropat was the satrap at the time of the persian achaemenid dynasty and gained independence after alexander the great destroyed the achaemenids the region was known as media atropatia or atropatene at the time there are also alternative opinions that the term is a slight turkification of azarbaijan in turn an arabicized version of the original persian name zar b dag n made up of zar badag n zar fire b dag cultivated area n suffix of pluralization that it traditionally means the land of eternal flames or the land of fire which is probabely implies zoroastrian fire temples in this land some azeri historians contend that the name is made up of four azerbaijani components az er bay can which means the land of the brave az people or an elevated place for the wealthy and exalted historically a large part of the territory of the present day azerbaijan republic has been called arran named after arran a legendary founder of caucasian albania however the precise location identified by this name has shifted somewhat over time currently referring to the lowland karabakh plains situated between the kura and araks rivers some opponents of the name azerbaijan assert that it is anachronistic to use it in a historical context before one nine one eight because they say the term was first introduced by the national intelligentsia in early two zero th century and later was endorsed by the bolsheviks with intention of claiming the northern province of persia to substantiate this claim they state that until the early two zero th century the population of present day azerbaijan had no clear ethnic identification and referred to themselves primarily as muslims history main article history of azerbaijan the earliest known inhabitants of what is today azerbaijan were the caucasian albanians a caucasian speaking people who appear to have been in the region prior to the host of peoples who would eventually invade the caucasus historically azerbaijan has been occupied by a variety of peoples including armenians persians romans arabs turks mongols greek empire and russians the first state to emerge in the territory of present day republic of azerbaijan was mannae in the nine th century bc lasting until six one six bc when it was overthrown by the medes the satrapies of atropatene and caucasian albania were established in the four th century bc and included the approximate territories of present day azerbaijan and southern parts of dagestan islam spread rapidly in azerbaijan following the arab conquests in the seven th eight th centuries after the power of the arab khalifate waned several semi independent states have been formed the shirvanshah kingdom being one of them in the one one th century the conquering seljuk turks became the dominant force in azerbaijan and laid the ethnic foundation of contemporary azerbaijanis or azeri turks in the one three one four th centuries the country experienced mongol tatar invasions azerbaijan was part of the safavid state in one five th one eight th centuries it also underwent a brief period of feudal fragmentation in the mid one eight th to early one nine th centuries and consisted of independent khanates following the two wars between the qajar dynasty of persia and the russian empire azerbaijan was acquired by russia through the treaty of gulistan in one eight one three and the treaty of turkmenchay in one eight two eight after the collapse of the russian empire during world war i azerbaijan declared independence and established the azerbaijan democratic republic this first muslim republic in the world lasted only two years from one nine

commented on these elections human rights watch research found that the government has heavily intervened in the campaigning process in favor of prime minister ilham aliev son of current president heidar aliev the government has stacked the central election commission and local election commission with its supporters and banned local non governmental organizations from monitoring the vote as the elections draw nearer government officials have openly sided with the campaign of ilham aliev constantly obstructing opposition rallies and attempting to limit public participation in opposition

astronomy in the us is a hobby whose participants enjoy observing celestial objects it is usually associated with viewing the night sky when most celestial objects and events are visible but sometimes amateur astronomers also operate during the day for events such as sunspots and solar eclipses amateur astronomers often look at the sky using nothing more than their eyes but common tools for amateur astronomy include portable telescopes and binoculars aurora australis display over wellington nz november two zero zero one published by nasa spaceweather com comet neat over wellington nz two zero zero three amateur astronomy and scientific research unlike professional astronomy scientific research is not always the main goal for many amateur astronomers work of scientific merit is certainly possible however and many amateurs contribute to the knowledge base of professional astronomers very successfully astronomy is often promoted as one of the few remaining sciences for which amateurs can still contribute useful data the majority of scientific contributions by amateur astronomers are in the area of data collection in particular this applies where large numbers of amateur astronomers with small telescopes are more effective than the relatively small number of large telescopes that are available to professional astronomers several organisations such as the center for backyard astrophysics exist to help coordinate these contributions in particular amateur astronomers often contribute toward activities such as monitoring the changes in brightness of variable stars helping to track asteroids and observing occultations to determine both the shape of asteroids and the shape of the terrain on the apparent edge of the moon as seen from earth in the past and present amateur astronomers have also played a major role in discovering new comets recently however funding of projects such as the lincoln near earth asteroid research and near earth asteroid tracking projects has meant that most comets are now discovered by automated systems long before it is possible for amateurs to see them a newer role for amateurs is searching for overlooked phenomena e g kreutz sungrazers in the vast libraries of digital images and other data captured by earth and space based observatories much of which is available over the internet societies for amateur astronomy there are a large number of amateur astronomical societies around the world that serve as a meeting point for those interested in amateur astronomy whether they be people who are actively interested in observing or armchair astronomers who may be simply interested in the topic societies range widely in their goals depending on a variety of factors such as geographic spread local circumstances size and membership for instance a local society in the middle of a large city may have regular meetings with speakers focusing less on observing the night sky if the membership is less able to observe due to factors such as light pollution it is common for local societies to hold regular meetings which may include activities such as star parties other activities could include amateur telescope making which was pioneered in america by russell w porter who later played a major role in design and construction of the hale telescope approaches to using amateur telescopes amateur telescopes come in many shapes and sizes both commercial and home built the preferences of people who use them often differ star hopping some amateur astronomers prefer to learn the sky as accurately as they can using maps to find their way between the stars in this case a common approach is to use binoculars or a manually driven telescope combined with star maps to locate items of interest in the sky the normal technique for doing this by locating landmark stars and hopping between them is called star hopping goto telescopes more recently as technology has improved and prices have come down automated goto telescopes have also become a popular choice with these computer driven telescopes the user typically enters the name of the item they wish to look at and the telescope finds it in the sky automatically with comparatively little further effort required by the user the main advantage of a goto telescope for an experienced amateur astronomer is the reduction of wasted time that may have otherwise been used in trying to find a particular object this time can therefore be used more effectively for studying the object comparing methodologies there is significant though usually light hearted debate within the hobby about which method is better promoters of the star hopping approach for finding items in the sky usually argue that they know the sky much better as a result the manual method also tends to require simpler equipment with less calibration and setup time and is therefore more versatile promoters of goto telescopes often argue that they are more interested in studying objects and the reward of finding them or learning exactly where they are is not as important to them it may also be argued that the money spent on complex electronics and mounting systems might be better spent on higher quality optics additional tools and activities in addition to optical equipment amateur astronomers use a variety of other tools such as celestial maps and specialised computer software there is a range of astronomy software available from planetarium programs that simulate the sky to programs used to do various kinds of calculations pertaining to astronomical phenomena most amateur astronomers also keep a record of their observations this can take the form of an observing log in which they record details about which objects were observed and describing the details that were seen astrophotography and sketching are also popularly used to record observations beginning in amateur astronomy there are a many ways for people to become involved in amateur astronomy and study the night sky one option is to join a local astronomical society the members of which will often be very happy to help a newcomer take a more active part some people also prefer to simply teach themselves in which case there are likely to be a large amount of books in the local library common objects that are observed early are the moon and planets another thing that most newcomers to amateur astronomy become acquainted with are the more prominent constellations in the night sky when reading maps and interpreting instructions for future star hopping constellations are good starting points for identifying locations in the night sky they are frequently referred to by amateur astronomers when discussing the location of items of interest when looked at with binoculars and telescopes beginning with a goto telescope a relatively new type of beginning amateur astronomer brought about by the increased affordability of powerful goto telescopes is one who begins with such a telescope it is possible for an inexperienced person to immediately look at a large amount of deep sky objects in the night sky without necessarily having any prior experience or training there is currently some debate among amateur astronomers about the merits of this approach to becoming involved in the hobby and the effects that low priced goto telescopes may be having amateur astronomy is exposed to more people as an individual is less likely to be discouraged by the need to learn how to locate objects in the night sky before being able to see them some are concerned however that newcomers may become bored very quickly a goto telescope does not distinguish between objects that are easy and hard to see and newcomers may therefore begin with objects that require large amounts of experience or understanding to properly appreciate becoming acquainted with the night sky most tutors agree that it is very important to know one s way around the sky by means of the constellations this ability forms a platform from which deeper explorations of the sky are then possible a planisphere can be used to find and identify the constellations these devises show the location of the constellations for any time of the night or time of the year an observer will also need a red flashlight to read star charts or the planisphere use of a red light helps preserve the dark adaptation of the eyes having learned the main constellations a beginner may want to extend their hobby and buy a pair of binoculars or a telescope using binoculars with binoculars it is possible to see many deep sky objects dsos holding the binoculars can produce a shaky image one way to improve the view is with the aid of a sturdy tripod mount to steady the view through the binoculars binoculars are still limited in range although most of the messier catalogue should be visible as well as a great many ngc s especially near the milky way an advantage of binoculars is that they allow more complete wide field views of the larger open clusters such as the pleiades the hyades the coma berenices cluster and praesepe for example of which only portions are usually observable in one field of view at higher magnifications using a telescope with a telescope the sky really comes alive especially one that has an aperture of six inches or more some amateur telescopes are built by their owners from scratch but many good quality telescopes can be purchased from reputable companies thousands of dsos are visible in a telescope and the determined amateur with a large about four one cm telescope can push this to tens of thousands or more another type of telescope to consider especially if the amateur is observing with children is a wide field telescope such as edmund scientific s f four astroscan compact reflector this type of telescope is typically a short tube reflector and has an aperture of only eight zero to one two zero mm three one four to four three four inches but is easier to target an object since it offers a much wider field of view with the aid of high power lenses i e eyepieces the amateur can zoom in on planets and some of the closer dsos it is the best of a blend of a telescope s narrow long range light gathering ability with a binocular s wider field of view those who are particularly interested in observing the moon and planets may prefer a high power design such as the maksutov telescope with any telescope though the mount is the most important feature a tripod that doesn t shake every time one uses it is a must too many amateur astronomers give up because they have a hard time targeting an object if the mounting tripod is rock solid the amateur can enjoy their time observing the heavens instead of fighting with the telescope astrophotography a photo taken of comet hale bopp using a standard three five mm camera with a five zero mm lens and four zero zero iso film the exposure was taken for one zero seconds on a tripod using a shutter cable release the next step in an amateur astronomer s quest for more space adventure could be the purchase of a good camera for astrophotography starting out with a good three five mm camera with a five zero mm lens mounted on a tripod and using a cable release and four zero zero or faster speed film the amateur can capture some nice pictures of the planets and some larger nebula like the orion nebula some of the larger comets and prolific meteor showers can be photographed this way as well as one progresses cameras can be mounted directly on to telescopes capturing on film many dsos special films and even the technique of hypering the film has been employed by the amateur many publications accept these astrophotos in their magazines i e astronomy and sky telescope a more recent development is the use of webcams to do speckle imaging also known as video astronomy the resulting short exposure frames can be stacked using the shift and add method of speckle imaging or selected to do lucky imaging all using commercially available astronomy software sketching as an alternative to photography in order to make a record of observations amateurs also use sketching sketching does not require the use of any specialized equipment and is therefore suitable for beginners as well as advanced amateur observers there are different approaches to sketching that require different tools simple pencil sketches can sometimes be used to make accurate renditions of what the observer sees through binoculars or a telescope as the expewrience of the observer increases more advanced drawing tools and techniques can be employed sketching has the advantage of helping the observer scrutinize the object that is seen and can help bring out details that otherwise might have been overlooked

society for popular astronomy the uk s biggest society for amateur astronomers astroscopic labs amateur astrophotography reviews and articles amateur astronomy aikido aikid also using an older style of kanji literally meaning joining energy way is a gendai budo a modern japanese martial art practitioners of aikido are known as aikidoka it was developed by morihei ueshiba also known by aikidoka as o sensei over the period of the one nine three zero s to the one nine six zero s technically the major parts of aikido are derived from dait ry aiki j jutsu a form of jujutsu with many joint techniques and kenjutsu or japanese sword technique some believe the tactics in aikido are especially influenced by yagy shinkage ry aikido is also considered to contain a significant spiritual component history the name aikido is formed of three japanese characters usually romanised as ai ki and do these are often translated as meaning union universal energy and way so aikido can be translated as the way to union with universal energy another common interpretation of the characters is harmony spirit and way so aikido can also mean the way of spiritual harmony both interpretations draw attention to the fact that aikido s techniques are designed to control an attacker by controlling and redirecting their energy instead of blocking it an analogy is often made of the way a flexible willow bends with the storm whereas the stout oak will break if the wind blows too hard the korean martial art commonly known as hapkido uses the same three characters some suggest a historical link through daito ryu the main origin of aikido morihei ueshiba developed aikido mainly from daito ryu aikijutsu incorporating training movements such as those for the yari spear jo a short quarterstaff and perhaps also juken bayonet but arguably the strongest influence is that of the katana sword in many ways an aikido practitioner moves as an empty handed swordsman the aikido strikes shomenuchi and yokomenuchi originated from weapon attacks and resultant techniques likewise from weapon take aways some schools of aikido do no weapons training at all others such as iwama ryu usually spend substantial time with bokken bokuto wooden sword jo and tanto knife in some lines of aikido all techniques can be performed with a sword as well as unarmed aikido was first brought to the west in one nine five one by minoru mochizuki with a visit to france it was introduced to the united states in one nine five three by kenji tomiki and a little later in the same year by koichi tohei the united kingdom followed in one nine five five germany and australia in one nine six five today there are many aikido dojos available to train at throughout the world technique aikido incorporates a wide range of techniques which use principles of energy and motion to redirect neutralise and control attackers one of the central martial philosophies of aikido is to be able to handle multiple attacker circumstances fluidly randori practice against multiple opponents is a key part of the curriculum in most aikido schools and is required for the higher level belts another tenet of aikido is that the aikidoka should gain control of their opponent as quickly as possible while causing the least amount of damage possible to either party if performed correctly size and strength are not important for the techniques to be effective training the methods of training vary from organisation to organisation and indeed even between different dojo in a single organisation typically however a class consists of a teacher demonstrating techniques or principles which the students then practice training is done through mutual technique where the focus is on entering and blending harmonising with the attack rather than on meeting force with force uke the receiver of the technique usually initiates an attack against nage also referred to as tori or shite depending on aikido style who neutralises it with an aikido technique the uke and the nage have equally important roles uke s role is to be honest and committed in attack to use positioning to protect oneself and to learn proper technique through the imbalanced feeling created by nage s technique nage s role is to blend with and neutralise uke s attack without leaving an opening to further attacks simultaneously nage will be studying how to create a feeling of being centred on balance and controlled in the application of the aikido technique therefore students must practise both positions in order to learn proper technique when o sensei taught all his students were uke until he deemed them knowledgeable enough of the technique to be nage movement awareness precision distance and timing are all important to the execution of techniques as students progress from rigidly defined exercises to more fluid and adaptable applications eventually students take part in jiyu waza free attack and or randori where the attacks are less predictable most schools employ training methods wherein uke actively attempts to employ counter techniques or kaeshi waza o sensei did not allow competition in training because some techniques were considered too dangerous and because he believed that competition did not develop good character in students most styles of aikido continue this tradition although shodokan aikido see styles started with competitions early on in the ki society there are forms taigi competitions held from time to time defense aikido techniques are largely designed towards keeping the attacker off balance and locking joints much of aikido s repertoire of defenses can be performed either as throwing techniques nage waza or as pins katame waza depending on the situation entering irimi and turning tenkan are widely used aikido concepts as is striking atemi the use of striking techniques is dependent on the organization and to some extent the individual dojo some dojo teach the strikes that are integral to all aikido techniques as mere distractions used to make the application of an aikido technique easier while others teach that strikes are to be used for more destructive reasons o sensei himself wrote while describing the aikido technique ikkyo first smash the eyes this might well refer to the fact that the classic opener for ikkyo is a knife hand thrust towards the face to make uke block and thus expose his or her arm to the joint control thus as though moving to smash uke s eyes manipulation of uke s balance by entering is often referred to as taking uke s center it is sometimes said that aikido contains only defense and the attacks that are performed are not really aikido from a historical perspective this claim is questionable but many if not most aikidoka have the defense techniques as the focus of their training attacks in the early days when ueshiba began teaching to the public students tended to be proficient in another martial art due to this attacks per se are generally not focused on in contemporary aikido dojos students will learn the various attacks from which an aikido technique can be practiced although attacks seldom are studied to the same extent as some arts good attacks are needed to study correct and effective application of technique honest attacks are considered important an honest attack would be an attack with full intention or a strong neutral neither pulling or pushing grab or hold the speed of an attack may vary depending on the experience and level of the nage the partner who executes the throw or technique whether the attack is fast or slow the uke s intention to strike or control if grabbing or pinning should remain in order to provide the nage a realistic training scenario aikido attacks used in normal training include various stylized strikes and grabs such as shomenuchi a vertical strike to the head yokomenuchi a lateral strike to the side of the head and or neck munetsuki a straight punch ryotedori a two handed grab or katadori a shoulder grab many of the uchi strikes resemble blows from a sword or other weapon kicks are sometimes used but are not usually part of basic curricula most aikido techniques can also be applied to a response to an attack e g to a block and some schools use this as the basic form of a given class of technique beginners also tend to work with techniques executed in response to a grab grabs are considered good for basic practice because the connection with uke is very clear and strong and it is easier to feel out body mechanics and lines of force there is also the matter of atemi or strikes employed during an aikido technique the role and importance of atemi is a matter of some debate in aikido some view atemi as strikes to vital points that can be delivered during the course of a technique s application to increase effectiveness others consider atemi to be methods of distraction particularly when aimed at the face for instance if a movement would expose the aikido practitioner to a counter blow he or she may deliver a quick strike to distract the attacker or occupy the threatening limb such a strike will also usually break the target s concentration making them easier to throw than if they are able to focus on resisting atemi can be interpreted as not only punches or kicks but also for instance striking with a shoulder or a large part of the arm some throws are arguably effected through an unbalancing or abrupt application of atemi many sayings about atemi are attributed to morihei ueshiba although their precise content varies considerably based on the one doing the telling weapons weapons training in aikido usually consists of jo four foot staff bokken wooden sword and wooden or sometimes rubber tanto knife both weapons taking and weapons retention are sometimes taught to integrate the armed and unarmed aspects of aikido for example a technique done with a straight punch may be done with a tanto or jo thrust instead or a grab technique may be illustrated as a way to draw strike with a weapon while being grabbed many schools use versions of morihiro saito s weapons system aiki jo and aiki ken the system contains solo kata with jo and paired exercises for both jo and bokken some lineages use bokken kata derived from older sword schools also quite a few aikido teachers such as mitsugi saotome and kazuo chiba have developed their own weapons systems this is largely due to the fact that o sensei did not teach weapons to his students excepting a few clothing the aikidogi used in aikido is similar to the keikogi used in most other modern budo arts simple trousers and a wraparound jacket usually white in some places a keikogi of karate cut is preferred in others most people use judo keikogis keikogi made specially for aikido exist but usually not in the lower price ranges many dojos insist that the sleeves are cut short to elbow length to reduce the risk of trapped fingers and injuries in grab techniques to the wrist to the keikogi adds the traditional garment hakama wide pleated trousers the hakama is usually black or dark blue and in most dojos the hakama is reserved for practitioners with dan black belt ranks systems also exist where hakama is never worn or are worn from a specific kyu rank others exist where women are allowed to wear it earlier than men the belt obi is wrapped twice around the body similar to in karate or judo although some systems use many belt colours similar to the system in judo the most common version is that dan ranks wear black belt and kyu ranks white sometimes with an additional brown belt for the highest kyu ranks in some dojos it is common to have the same color belt at different levels spirituality the ending do in the word aikido indicates a spiritual path unlike the ending jutsu in the word aikijujutsu which indicates a system of techniques many people see this difference as important as well as regarding iaijutsu and iaido jujutsu and judo and kenjutsu and kendo others see this distinction as a historically incorrect and somewhat unnatural division for example literally do refers to a path and jitsu to a technique therefore some argue aikido involves both a way do and technical study jutsu ueshiba taught that while it was important to become proficient in physical technique this is not the ultimate purpose of training he taught that the principles learned through training in physical technique are universal and are to be applied to all aspects of one s life he once commented that he was teaching students not how to move their feet but rather how to move their minds many agree that ueshiba s style became softer more fluid and effortless as he grew older some suggest this was due to a shift in focus to the spiritual aspects of the art while others suggest that this was simply a natural result of ueshiba becoming more proficient in physical technique various interpretations have arisen since ueshiba s death a range of aikido schools can be found each placing a different emphasis on physical techniques underlying principles and spiritual concepts this is largely a result of at what point the founder of each of these schools trained with ueshiba earlier or later in ueshiba s life the former tend to focus more on physical technique while the latter tend to focus more on spiritual concepts however this should not be overstated especially since there is considerable variance from sensei to sensei and an aikido continuum is quite problematic to actually construct some aikidoka view physical vs spiritual as a false separation or a failed attempt to stereotype branches of aikido ki society is an example of a school that focuses heavily on the spiritual concepts of aikido rather than physical technique ki obsolete form of the ki kanji the japanese character for ki is a symbolic representation of a lid covering a pot full of rice the steam being contained within is ki this same word is applied to the ability to harness one s own breath power power or energy this ki is the same as the qi in qi gong but many people argue it is not the same as the chi in t ai chi when aikidoka say that someone is training with a lot of ki they usually want to express that the person is very non forcefully compelling in the execution of his technique timing a sense for the correct distance and a centered undisturbed mind and body are particularly important most teachers claim to locate ki in the hara which might be loosely defined as the body s center of gravity situated in the lower abdomen about two inches below and behind the navel in training it is constantly emphasized that one should keep one s hara that is remain centered very high ranking teachers sometimes reach a level of coordination that enables them to execute techniques with very little apparent movement sometimes even without seeming to touch their opponent s body essentially ki corresponds to the physical concepts of center of gravity center of momentum and center of force however these centers are not necessarily the same so ki also encompasses the biological and mental aspect of training oneself to have exquisite control over motion the spiritual interpretation of ki depends very much on what school of aikido one studies as some emphasize it more than others ki society dojos for example tend to spend much more time on ki related training activities than do for example yoshinkan dojos the importance of ki in aikido cannot be denied the name of the martial art after all can be translated as the meeting of ki but what ki is is debated by many within the discipline o sensei himself appears to have changed his views over time for example yoshinkan aikido which largely follows o sensei s teachings from before the war is considerably more martial in nature reflecting a younger more violent and less spiritual o sensei within this school ki perhaps could be better thought of as having its original chinese meaning of breath and aikido as coordination of movement with breath to maximize power as o sensei evolved and his views changed his teachings took on a much more ethereal feel and many of his later students almost all now high ranking senseis within the aikikai teach about ki from this perspective see also qi qigong body aikido training is for all around physical fitness flexibility and relaxation the human body in general can exert power in two ways contractive and expansive aikidofaq com many fitness activities for example weight lifting emphasize the former which means that specific muscles or muscle groups are isolated and worked to improve tone mass and power the disadvantage of this however is that whole body movement and coordination are rarely stressed thus while muscle size and power may increase there is no emphasis on the ways in which those muscles can work together most efficiently also this sort of training tends to increase tension decrease flexibility and stress the joints the result may be aesthetically pleasing but when done to excess may actually be detrimental to overall health the second type of power expansive is mostly stressed in activities such as dance or gymnastics in these activities the body must learn to move in a coordinated manner and with relaxation aikido also mostly stresses this sort of training while both types of power are important it is interesting to note that a person who masters the second type of power can in a martial context often overcome a person who is much bigger or stronger the reason for this is that the contractive power is only as great as the mass and power of your individual muscles expansive power however as used in aikido can be much greater than your size may lead you to believe this is because you move with your whole body rather than stressing and tensing only a few muscles you learn to relax and move from the center of your body where you are most powerful power is then extended out naturally through the relaxed limbs which become almost whip like in their motion needless to say the power behind an entire person s body will be more than that of someone s arm or leg alone hence aikido develops the body in a unique manner aerobic fitness is obtained through vigorous training flexibility of the joints and connective tissues is developed through various stretching exercises and through the techniques themselves relaxation is learned automatically since without it the techniques will not function a balanced use of contractive and expansive power is mastered enabling even a small person to pit his entire body s energy against their opponent with this different masters stress different aspects of training some masters stress importance of body posture while executing the technique in order to coordinate different parts of the body while others deal with the physical aspects of it with each way comes a different means of interpretation of the same basic principles of the art which is discussed in more detail above mind aikido training does not consider the body and mind as independent entities the condition of one affects the other for example the physical relaxation learned in aikido also becomes a mental relaxation likewise the confidence that develops mentally is manifested in a more confident style psychological or spiritual insight learned during training must become reflected in the body else it will vanish under pressure when more basic ingrained patterns and reflexes take over aikido training requires the student to squarely face conflict not to run away from it through this experience an aikido student may learn to face other areas of life in a similarly proactive fashion rather than in with avoidance and fear styles the major styles of aikido each have their own hombu dojo in japan have an international breadth and were founded by direct students of morihei ueshiba although there has been an explosion of independent styles generally only the first five listed have been considered major iwama ryu is a debatable sixth as although its influence is major it has until recently been part of the aikikai see below aikikai is the largest aikido organisation and is led by the family of the founder numerous sub organisations and teachers affiliate themselves with this umbrella organisation which therefore encompasses a wide variety of aikido styles training methods and technical differences these sub organisations are often centred around prominant shihan and are usually organised at the national level although sub national and inter national sub organisations exist please see list of famous aikidoka for more detail yoshinkan founded by gozo shioda has a reputation for being the most rigidly precise students of yoshinkan aikido practise basic movements as solo kata and this style has been popular among the japanese police the international organization associated with the yoshinkan style of aikido is known as the yoshinkai and has active branches in many parts of the world yoseikan was founded by minoru mochizuki who was an early student of o sensei and also of jigoro kano at the kodokan this style includes elements of aiki budo together with aspects of karate judo and other arts it is now carried on by his son hiroo mochizuki the creator of yoseikan budo shodokan aikido often called tomiki aikido after its founder use sparring and rule based competition in training as opposed to most others people tend to compete to train rather than to train to compete kenji tomiki an early student of o sensei and also of judo s jigoro kano believed that introducing an element of competition would serve to sharpen and focus the practice since it was no longer tested in real combat this latter view was the cause of a split with o sensei s family who firmly believed that there was no place for competition in aikido training tomiki said that at no point did o sensei actually cast him out the ki society founded by former head instructor of the hombu dojo one zero th dan koichi tohei emphasizes very soft flowing techniques and has a special program for the development of ki it also has a special system of ki ranks alongside the traditional kyu and dan system this style is called shin shin toitsu aikido or ki aikido iwama ryu emphasizes the relation between weapon techniques and barehand techniques and a great deal of emphasis is placed on weapons training since the death of its founder morihiro saito the iwama style has been practiced by clubs within the aikikai and an independent organization headed by hitohiro saito saito sensei was a long time uchideshi of o sensei beginning in one nine four six and staying with him through his death many consider that saito sensei was the student who spent most time directly studying with o sensei saito sensei said he was trying to preserve and teach the art exactly as the founder of aikido taught it to him technically iwama ryu seems to resemble the aikido o sensei was teaching in the early five zero s mainly in the iwama dojo the technical repertoire is fairly large the new separate from aikikai iwama ryu aikido has been renamed iwama shin shin aikishurenkai shin ei taido founded by the late noriaki inoue nephew of morihei ueshiba yoshokai aikido begun by then hachidan takashi kushida of yoshinkan aikido is a remarkably centralized style of aikido with test techniques yearly passed down with explanations from the home dojo the syllabus contains a considerable amount of weapons study and like yoshinkan yoshokai includes many solo movements and exercises doshinkan aikido begun by yukio utada of yoshinkan aikido utada was a student of both the yoshinkan founder gozo shioda and yoshokai founder takashi kushida like yoshokai the syllabus also contains a considerable amount of weapons study and like yoshinkan doshinkan includes many solo movements and exercises doshinkan aikido aikido association of north america and doshinkan aikido international is still affiliated with the international yoshinkan aikido federation tendoryu aikido headed by kenji shimizu shin budo kai headed by shizuo imaizumi kokikai aikido founded by shuji maruyama in one nine eight six focuses on minimalist but effective technique it emphasizes natural stances and ukemi that do not require high breakfalls and deemphasizes atemi and techniques that cause pain or undue discomfort to uke as such it is considered by some to be a soft style of aikido seidokan aikido founded by rod kobayashi tends to utilize movements which are very small and economical encourages students to discover an aikido which is truly their own stresses the importance of doing away with the extraneous and focusing on that which works nippon kan headed by gaku homma nishio aikido a part of the aikikai although techically well defined according to its head shoji nishio nishio sensei passed away in march two zero zero five nihon goshin aikido headed by richard bowe it is considered a hard style of aikido combining techniques from karate judo and daito ryu aikijutsu there are roughly a dozen dojos in the united states

large but loose collection of essays multimedia and humour aikido journal website the most comprehensive source of aikido historical information aikido japanese martial arts winged victory of samothrace exihibited in the louvre by its original and broadest definition art from the latin ars meaning skill or craft is the product or process of the effective application of a body of knowledge and a set of skills this meaning is preserved in such phrases as liberal arts and martial arts however in the modern use of the word which rose to prominence during the renaissance art is commonly understood to be the process or result of making material works or artwork which from concept to creation adhere to the creative impulse that is art is distinguished from other works by being in large part unprompted by necessity by biological drive or by any undisciplined pursuit of recreation by both definitions of the word artistic works have existed for almost as long as humankind from early pre historic art to contemporary art the creative arts are a collection of disciplines whose principal purpose is in the output of material that is compelled by a personal drive and echoes or reflects a message mood and symbolism for the viewer to interpret as such the term art may be taken to include forms as diverse as prose writing poetry dance acting music sculpture and painting in addition to serving as a method of pure creativity and self expression the purpose of works of art may be to communicate ideas such as in politically religiously and philosophically motivated art to create a sense of beauty see aesthetics and fine art or pleasure or to generate strong emotions the purpose may also be seemingly nonexistent as a form of cultural expression art may be defined by the pursuit of diversity and the usage of narratives of liberation and exploration i e art history art criticism and art theory to mediate its boundaries this distinction may be applied to objects or performances current or historical and its prestige extends to those who made found exhibit or own them other than originality there are no widely agreed upon criteria for what is or isn t considered art and there are many divergent definitions of art to seek more specific requirements etymology the word art derives from the latin ars which roughly translates to skill or craft and derives in turn from an indo european root meaning arrangement or to arrange this is the only near universal definition of art that whatever is described as such has undergone a deliberate process of arrangement by an agent a few examples where this meaning proves very broad include artifact artificial artifice artillery medical arts and military arts however there are many other colloquial uses of the word all with some relation to its etymological roots art forms there are a variety of arts including visual arts and design decorative arts plastic arts and the performing arts artistic expression takes many forms painting drawing printmaking sculpture music literature and architecture are the most widely recognised forms however since the advent of modernism and the technological revolution new forms have emerged these include photography film video art installation art conceptual art performance art community arts land art fashion comics computer art anime and most recently video games within each form a wide range of genres may exist for instance a painting may be a still life a portrait or a landscape and may deal with historical or domestic subjects in addition a work of art may be representational or abstract most forms of art fit under two main categories fine arts and applied arts though there is no clear dividing line in the visual arts the term fine arts most often refers to painting and sculpture arts which have little or no practical function and are valued in terms of the visual pleasure they provide or their success in communicating ideas or feelings other visual arts typically designated as fine arts include printmaking drawing photography film and video though the tools used to realize these media are often used to make applied or commercial art as well architecture typically confounds the distinctions between fine and applied art since the form involves designing structures that strive to be both attractive and functional the term applied arts is most often used to describe the design or decoration of functional objects to make them visually pleasing artists who create applied arts or crafts are usually referred to as designers artisans or craftspeople defining art there is often confusion about the meaning of the term art because multiple meanings of the word are used interchangeably individuals use the word art to identify painting as well as singing characteristics of art there follow some generally accepted characteristics of art after this there is some lengthier discussion of several of those facets perceived as universal or central to art encourages an intuitive understanding rather than a rational understanding as for example with an article in a scientific journal was created with the intention of evoking such an understanding or an attempt at such an understanding in the audience was created with no other purpose or function other than to be itself a radical pure art definition elusive in that the work may communicate on many different levels of appreciation one may take the example of gericault s raft of the medusa in the case of which special knowledge concerning the shipwreck the painting depicts is not a prerequisite to appreciating it but allows the appreciation of gericault s political intentions in the piece in relation to the above the piece may offer itself to many different interpretations or though it superficially depicts a mundane event or object invites reflection upon elevated themes demonstrates a high level of ability or fluency within a medium this characteristic might be considered a point of contention since many modern artists most notably conceptual artists do not themselves create the works they conceive or do not even create the work in a conventional demonstrative sense one might think of tracey emin s controversial my bed the conferral of a particularly appealing or aesthetically satisfying structure or form upon an original set of unrelated passive constituents skill art can connote a sense of trained ability or mastery of a medium an example of this is the contemporary young master josignacio creator of plastic paint medium it can also simply refer to the developed and efficient use of a language so as to convey meaning with immediacy and or depth a common view is that the epithet art particular in its elevated sense requires a certain level of creative expertise by the artist whether this be a demonstration of technical ability such as one might find in many works of the rennaissance or in the plays of shakespeare or an originality in stylistic approach or a combination of these two for example a common contemporary criticism of some modern painting occurs along the lines of objecting to the apparent lack of skill or ability required in the production of the artistic object one might take tracey emin s my bed or hirst s the physical impossibility of death in the mind of someone living as examples of pieces wherein the artist exercised little to no traditionally recognised sets of skills in the first case emin simply slept and engaged in other activities in her bed before placing the result in a gallery she has however been insistent that there is a high degree of selection and arrangement in this work which includes objects such as underwear and bottles around the bed in the second case hirst came up with the conceptual design for the artwork although he physically particpated in the creation of this piece he has left the eventual creation of many other works to employed artisans these approaches are exemplary of a particular kind of contemporary art conceptual art the exclusionary view that art requires a certain skill level to produce is often described as a lay critique it derives from the fact that in western culture at least art has traditionally been pushed in the direction of representationalism the literal presentation of reality through literal images on the other hand criticism has often been brought to bear on modern artists for having no creative involvement whatsoever in their creations one might take hirst s work again as emblematic of this approach it may be further noted that certain forms of art outside a western tradition such as islamic geometric designs and calligraphy buddhist or hindu mandalas and celtic knotwork though they are non representational still require a measure of skill and certain creative involvement in their execution judgments of value somewhat in relation to the above the word art is also used to apply judgments of value as in such expressions as that meal was a work of art the cook is an artist or the art of deception the highly attained level of skill of the deceiver is praised it is this use of the word as a measure of high quality and high value that gives the term its flavor of subjectivity making judgments of value requires a basis for criticism at the simplest level a way to determine whether the impact of the object on the senses meets the criteria to be considered art whether it is perceived to be attractive or repellent though perception is always colored by experience and thus a reaction to art on these grounds is necessarily subjective it is commonly taken that that which is not aesthetically satisfying in some fashion cannot be art however good art is not always or even regularly aesthetically appealing to a majority of viewers in other words an artist s prime motivation need not be the pursuit of the aesthetic and art often depicts terrible images made for social moral or thought provoking reasons for example francisco goya s painting depicting the spanish shootings of three rd of may one eight zero eight is a graphic depiction of a firing squad executing several pleading civilians yet at the same time the horrific imagery demonstrates goya s keen artistic ability in composition and execution and his fitting social and political outrage thus the debate continues as to what mode of aesthetic satisfaction if any is required to define art the assumption of new values or the rebellion against accepted notions of what is aesthetically superior need not occur concurrently with a complete abandonment of the pursuit of that which is aesthetically appealing indeed the reverse is often true that in the revision of what is popularly conceived of as being aesthetically appealing allows for a re invigoration of aesthetic sensibility and a new appreciation for the standards of art itself countless schools have proposed their own ways to define quality yet they all seem to agree in at least one point once their aesthetic choices are accepted the value of the work of art is determined by its capacity to transcend the limits of its chosen medium in order to strike some universal chord or by the rarity of the skill of the artist or in its accurate reflection in what is termed the zeitgeist communicating emotion art appeals to human emotions it can arouse aesthetic or moral feelings and can be understood as a way of communicating these feelings artists have to express themselves so that their public is aroused but they do not have to do so consciously art explores what is commonly termed as the human condition that is essentially what it is to be human and art of a superior kind often brings about some new insight concerning humanity not always positive or demonstrates a level of skill so fine as to push forward the boundaries of collective human ability this is not to say that technical skill is a necessary prerequisite of art but rather that a high degree of skill goes some way in conferring a judgement of high standard upon an artist or artwork creative impulse from one perspective art is a generic term for any product of the creative impulse out of which sprang all other human pursuits such as science via alchemy and religion via shamanism the term art offers no true definition besides those based within the cultural historical and geographical context in which it is applied though to the artists themselves the impulse to create is undeniable an artist can no more deny that impulse than he she could ignore breathing one might compare kandinsky s inner necessity to this popular view it is because of the overbearing need to create in the face of financial ruin public obscurity or political opposition that artists are typically conceived of as unstable even crazy or misguided differences in defining art definitions of art and aesthetic arguments usually proceed from one of several possible perspectives art may be defined by the intention of the artist as in the writings of dewey art may be seen as being in the response emotion of the viewer as tolstoy claims in danto s view it can be defined as a character of the item itself or as a function of an object s context plato for plato art is a pursuit whose adherents are not to be trusted given that their productions imitate the sensory world itself an imitation of the divine world of forms art necessarily is an imitation of an imitation and thus is hopelessly far from the source of the truth plato it may be noted barred artists from access to his ideal city in his republic aristotle aristotle saw art in less of a bad light though he shared plato s poor opinion of it he nevertheless thought that art might serve the purpose of emotional catharsis that is by witnessing the sufferings and celebrations of actors onstage onlookers might vicariously experience these same feelings themselves and thereby purge such negative feelings institutional definition many people s opinions of what art is would fall inside a relatively small range of accepted standards or institutional definition of art george dickie one nine seven four this derives from education and other social factors most people did not consider the depiction of a brillo box or a store bought urinal to be art until andy warhol and marcel duchamp respectively placed them in the context of art i e the art gallery which then provided the association of these objects with the values that define art although strictly speaking warhol s artwork was not an actual brillo box but an exact replica of one so it met the traditional criterion of skill at the very least most viewers of these objects initially rejected such associations because the objects did not themselves meet the accepted criteria the objects needed to be absorbed into the general consensus of what art is before they achieved the near universal acceptance as art in the contemporary era once accepted and viewed with a fresh eye the smooth white surfaces of duchamp s urinal are strikingly similar to classical marble sculptural forms whether the artist intended it or not this type of recontextualizing provides the same spark of connection expected from any traditionally created art it should be noted however that duchamps act might be as readily interpreted as a demonstration of the not always beneficial power of artistic institutions rather than the universal art potentially inherent in all objects the placement of an object in an artistic context is not taken as a universal standard of art but is a common characteristic of conceptual art prevalent since the one nine six zero s notably the stuckist art movement criticises this tendency of recent art related issues social criticism art is often seen as belonging to one social class and excluding others in this context art is seen as a high status activity associated with wealth the ability to purchase art and the leisure required to pursue or enjoy it the palaces of versailles or the hermitage in st petersburg with their vast collections of art amassed by the fabulously wealthy royalty of europe exemplify this view collecting such art is the preserve of the rich in one viewpoint before the one three th century in europe artisans were considered to belong to a lower caste since they were essentially manual labourers after europe was re exposed to classical culture during the renaissance particularly in the nation states of what is now italy florence siena artists gained an association with high status however arrangements of fine and expensive goods have always been used by institutions of power as marks of their own status this is seen in the two zero th and two one st century by the commissioning or purchasing of art by big businesses and corporations as decoration for their offices utility there are many who ascribe to certain arts the quality of being non utilitarian this fits within the art as good system of definitions and suffers from a class prejudice against labor and utility opponents of this view argue that all human activity has some utilitarian function and these objects claimed to be non utilitarian actually have the rather mundane and banal utility of attempting to mystify and codify unworkable justifications for arbitrary social hierarchy it might also be argued that non utilitarian is in this context a mis usage that art is not in and of itself useless but rather that it particularly use does not manifest itself in any traditionally demonstrable way though advances in neuroscience may arguably enable the isolation of those associated cortices of the brain concerned with the creation or appreciation of art art is also used by art therapists and some psychotherapists and clinical psychologists as art therapy the end product is not the principal goal in this case rather a process of healing through creative acts is sought the resultant piece of artwork may also offer insight into the troubles experienced by the subject and may suggest suitable approaches to be used in more conventional forms of psychiatric therapy the use of art from the artist s standpoint is as a means of expression when art is conceived as a device it serves several context and perspective specific functions from the artist s perspective it allows one to symbolize complex ideas and emotions in an arbitrary language subject only to the interpretation of the self and peers in a social context it can serve to soothe the soul and promote popular morale in a more negative aspect of this facet art is often utilised as a form of propaganda and thus can be used to subtly influence popular conceptions or mood in some cases artworks are appropriated to be used in this manner without the creator s initial intention from a more anthropological perspective art is a way of passing ideas and concepts on to later generations in a somewhat universal language the interpretation of this language is very dependent upon the observer s perspective and context and it might be argued that the very subjectivity of art demonstrates its importance in providing an arena in which rival ideas might be exchanged and discussed or to provide a social context in which disparate groups of people might congregate and mingle history of art the term art history typically refers to a historical examination of the various trends of the visual arts through certain periods of human history it may also be taken to encompass a study of the theories of art which may or may not include an examination of their historical context symbols much of the development of individual artist deals with finding principles for how to express certain ideas through various kinds of symbolism for example vasily kandinsky developed his use of color in painting through a system of stimulus response where over time he gained an understanding of the emotions that can be evoked by color and combinations of color contemporary artist andy goldsworthy on the other hand chose to use the medium of found natural objects and materials to arrange temporary sculptures cultural differences of art several genres of art are grouped by cultural relevance examples can be found in terms such as african art american craft islamic art asian art as found in buddhist art chinese art

artist a female actor may be known as an actress although the term actor is also used as a gender neutral term an actor usually plays a fictional character in the case of a true story or a fictional story that portrays real people an actor may play a real person or a fictional version of the same occasionally actors appear as themselves etymology actor is directly from the masculine latin noun actor feminine actrix from the verb agere to do to drive to pass time the suffix or so st who performs the action indicated by the stem alternatively from greek aktor leader from the verb ag to lead or carry to convey to bring history the first recorded case of an actor performing took place in five three four bc probably on two three november though the changes in calendar over the years make it hard to determine exactly when the greek performer thespis stepped on to the stage at the theatre dionysus and became the first person to speak words as a character in a play the machinations of storytelling were immediately revolutionized prior to thespis act stories were told in song and dance and in third person narrative but no one had assumed the role of a character in a story in honour of thespis actors are commonly called thespians theatrical myth to this day maintains that thespis exists as a mischievous spirit and disasters in the theatre are sometimes blamed on his ghostly intervention actors were traditionally not people of high status and in the early middle ages travelling acting troupes were often viewed with distrust however this negative perception dramaticaly changed in two zero th century as acting became an honored and popular profession and art part of the reason is due to the rise of the popular appeal and access to dramatic film entertainment and the resulting rise of the movie star in social status and the large salaries they commanded the combination of public presence and wealth had a profound rehabilitation to the image in the past only men could become actors in the ancient and medieval world it was considered disgraceful for a woman to go on the stage and this belief continued right up until the one seven th century when in venice it was broken in the time of william shakespeare women s roles were played by men or boys though there is some evidence to suggest that women disguised as men also illegally performed actors playing the opposite sex women sometimes play the roles of prepubescent boys because in some regards a woman has a closer resemblance to a boy than does a man the role of peter pan for example is traditionally played by a woman the tradition of the principal boy in pantomime may be compared an adult playing a child occurs more in theater than in film the exception to this is voice actors in animated films where boys are generally voiced by women as heard in the simpsons opera has several pants roles traditionally sung by women usually mezzo sopranos examples are hansel in h nsel und gretel and cherubino in the marriage of figaro mary pickford played the part of little lord fauntleroy in the first film version of the book linda hunt won an academy award for best supporting actress in the year of living dangerously in which she played the part of a man having an actor play the opposite sex for comic effect is also a long standing tradition in comic theatre and film most of shakespeare s comedies include instances of cross dressing and both dustin hoffman and robin williams appeared in hit comedy films where they were required to play most scenes dressed as women tony curtis and jack lemmon famously posed as women to escape gangsters in the billy wilder film some like it hot techniques of acting actors employ a variety of techniques that are learned through training and experience some of these are the rigorous use of the voice to communicate a character s lines and express emotion this is achieved through attention to diction and projection through correct breathing and articulation it is also achieved through the tone and emphasis that an actor puts on words physicalisation of a role in order to create a believable character for the audience and to use the acting space appropriately and correctly use of gesture to complement the voice interact with other actors and to bring emphasis to the words in a play as well as having symbolic meaning shakespeare is believed to have been commenting on the acting style and techniques of his era when hamlet gives his famous advice to the players speak the speech i pray you as i pronounced it to you trippingly on the tongue but if you mouth it as many of your players do i had as lief the town crier spoke my lines nor do not saw the air too much with your hand thus but use all gently for in the very torrent tempest and as i may say the whirlwind of passion you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness o it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig pated fellow tear a passion to tatters to very rags to split the ears of the groundlings who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumbshows and noise i would have such a fellow whipped for o erdoing termagant it out herods herod pray you avoid it be not too tame neither but let your own discretion be your tutor suit the action to the word the word to the action with this special observance o erstep not the modesty of nature for any thing so overdone is from the purpose of playing whose end both at the first and now was and is to hold as twere the mirror up to nature to show virtue her own feature scorn her own image and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure now this overdone or come tardy off though it make the unskilful laugh cannot but make the judicious grieve the censure of the which one must in your allowance o erweigh a whole theatre of others o there be players that i have seen play and heard others praise and that highly not to speak it profanely that neither having the accent of christians nor the gait of christian pagan nor man have so strutted and bellowed that i have thought some of nature s journeymen had made men and not made them well they imitated humanity so abominably o reform it altogether and let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them for there be of them that will themselves laugh to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too though in the mean time some necessary question of the play be then to be considered that s villanous and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses

trilobites first appeared toward the end of the lower cambrian and thrived in the middle cambrian the last agnostids held out until the late ordovician the agnostida are divided into two suborders agnostina and eodiscina that are then divided into a number of families the eodiscina appear to be normal trilobites with only two or three segments in the thorax some resemble trilobites of the order ptychopariida as a group agnostids have pygidia tails that are similar in size and shape to their cephalons heads neither looks much like the corresponding regions of other trilobites there has been more than one argument about which end is the head agnostids were probably benthic bottom dwelling creatures most agnostid species have no eyes they likely lived on areas of the ocean floor that received little or no light and fed on detritus that descended from upper layers of the sea to the bottom unfortunately the appendages are known only for one genus of agnostid the legs of that genus look much more like crustacean legs than the legs of other trilobites with preserved appendages this has caused many taxonomists to question whether the agnostids are truly trilobites another view is that the agnostids represent the first line to have diverged from the trilobites however four orders of trilobites redlichiida corynexochida naraoidia ptychopariida considerably predate the earliest agnostids in the fossil record agnostina are generally referred to simply as agnostids even though they probably should be called agnostines external links agnostida fact sheet a guide to the eight orders of trilobites by sam gon iii prehistoric arthropods an abortion is the termination of a pregnancy associated with the death of an embryo or a fetus this can occur spontaneously in the form of a miscarriage or be intentionally induced through chemical surgical or other means generally abortions are performed by gynaecologists or obstetricians all mammalian pregnancies can be aborted however this article focuses exclusively on the abortion of human pregnancy there have been various methods of inducing an abortion throughout the centuries in the two zero th century the ethics and morality of abortion became the subject of intense political debate in many areas of the world definitions pregnancy is defined by the medical community as beginning at the implantation of the embryo others differ however placing this initiation at conception the following medical terms are used to define an abortion spontaneous abortion miscarriage an abortion due to accidental trauma or natural causes induced abortion an abortion deliberately caused induced abortions are further subcategorized into therapeutic abortions and elective abortions therapeutic abortion to save the life of the pregnant woman to preserve the woman s physical or mental health to terminate a pregnancy that would result in the birth of a child with defects which would be incompatible with life or associated with significant morbidity to selectively reduce the number of fetuses in a multiple pregnancy to lessen health risks involved elective abortion an abortion performed for any other reason methods of birth control that prevent implantation such as emergency contraception are not considered to be abortion however emergency contraception is generally considered equivalent to abortion by those who reject the medical definition of pregnancy a pregnancy that ends earlier than three seven completed weeks of gestation and where an infant is born and survives is termed a premature birth a pregnancy that ends with an infant dead upon birth at any gestational stage due to causes including spontaneous abortion or complications during delivery is termed a stillbirth in common parlance the term abortion is synonymous with induced abortion of a human fetus incidence the incidence of and reasons for induced abortion vary in regions in which abortion is generally permitted it has been estimated that the total number of induced abortions performed globally is approximately four six million per year two six million of these are said to occur in places in which abortion is legal the other two zero million happen where it is illegal some countries such as belgium and the netherlands experience a low rate of induced abortion while others like russia and vietnam have a comparatively high rate a one nine nine eight study aggregated data from studies in two seven countries on the reasons women seek to terminate their pregnancies it concluded that common factors cited to have influenced the abortion decision were the desire to delay or end childbearing concern over the interruption of work or education issues of financial or relationship stability and perceived immaturity in finland and the united states concern for the health risks posed by pregnancy in individual cases was not a factor commonly given whereas in bangladesh india and kenya such a concern was found to be more prevalent a two zero zero four study in which american women at clinics answered a questionnaire yielded similar results some abortions are undergone as the result of societal pressures such as eugenics the stigmatization of disabled persons preference for children of a specific sex disapproval of single motherhood insufficient economic support for families lack of access to or rejection of contraceptive methods or efforts toward population control such as china s one child policy a combination of these factors can sometimes result in forced abortion forced sterilization infanticide child abandonment or sex selective abortion and infanticide which is illegal in most countries but difficult to stop in many areas especially in developing nations or where abortion is illegal women sometimes resort to back alley or self induced procedures the world health organization suggests that there are one nine million terminations annually which fit its criteria for an unsafe abortion see social issues for more information on these subjects forms of abortion spontaneous abortion spontaneous abortions generally referred to as miscarriages occur when an embryo or fetus is lost due to natural causes a miscarriage is spontaneous loss of the embryo or fetus before the two zero th week of development spontaneous abortions after the two zero th week are generally considered to be preterm deliveries most miscarriages occur very early in a pregnancy approximately one zero five zero of pregnancies end in miscarriage depending upon the age and health of the pregnant woman the risk for spontaneous abortion is greater in those with a history of more than three previous known spontaneous abortions those who have had a previous induced abortion those with systemic diseases and in women over age three five other causes can be infection of either the woman or the fetus immune responses or serious systemic diseases of the woman a spontaneous abortion can also be caused by accidental trauma intentional trauma to cause miscarriage is considered an induced abortion some governments have laws increasing the criminal liability of a person who causes a miscarriage during an assault or other violent crime induced abortion a pregnancy can be intentionally aborted in a number of ways the manner selected depends chiefly upon the gestational age of the fetus in addition to the legality regional availability and or doctor patient preference for specific procedures surgical abortion u s president george w bush signs the partial birth abortion ban act of two zero zero three in the first fifteen weeks suction aspiration or vacuum abortion is the most common method manual vacuum aspiration or mva abortion consists of removing the fetus or embryo by suction using a manual syringe while the electric vacuum aspiration or eva abortion method uses an electric pump these techniques are equivalent differing only in the mechanism use to apply suction from the fifteenth week up until around the twenty sixth week a surgical dilation and evacuation d e is used d e consists of opening the cervix of the uterus and emptying it using surgical instruments and suction dilation and curettage d c is a standard gynaecological procedure performed for a variety of reasons including examination of the uterine lining for possible malignancy investigation of abnormal bleeding and abortion curettage refers to the cleaning of the walls of the uterus with a curette the world health organization recommends this sort of procedure also called sharp curettage only when mva is unavailable sharp curettage only accounted for two four of abortion procedures in the us in two zero zero two the term d and c can more generally be used to refer to the first trimester abortion procedure irrespective of the method used to perform the procedure other techniques must be used to induce abortion in the third trimester premature delivery can be induced with prostaglandin this can be coupled with injecting the amniotic fluid with caustic solutions containing saline or urea very late abortions can be brought about by intact dilation and extraction intact d x which requires the surgical decompression of the fetus s head before evacuation and is sometimes termed partial birth abortion a hysterotomy abortion similar to a caesarian section but resulting in a terminated fetus can also be used at late stages of pregnancy it can be performed vaginally with an incision just above the cervix in the late mid trimester chemical abortion the molecular structure of the abortifacient drug mifepristone effective in the first trimester of pregnancy chemical also referred to as a medical abortion or non surgical abortions comprise one zero of all abortions in the united states and europe the process begins with the administration of either methotrexate or mifepristone followed by misoprostol when appropriately used nine eight of women undergoing medical termination of pregnancy will experience completed abortion without surgical intervention the food and drug administration currently approves the use of mifepristone up to four nine days gestation seven weeks though evidence based regimens exist for its use up to six one days gestation with similar success rates misoprostol alone can also be used though it is not fda approved for this purpose misoprostol cytotec alone has the advantage of costing less than one dollar for an effective dose as opposed to several hundred dollars for an effective dose of mifepristone in cases of failure of medical abortion vacuum or manual aspiration is used to complete the abortion surgically other means of abortion historically a number of herbs reputed to possess abortifacient properties have been used in folk medicine tansy pennyroyal black cohosh and the now extinct silphium see history of abortion the use of herbs in such a manner can cause serious even lethal side effects such as multiple organ failure and is not recommended by physicians abortion is sometimes attempted through means of trauma to the abdomen the degree of force applied if severe can cause serious internal injuries without necessarily succeeding in inducing miscarriage both accidental and deliberate abortions of this kind can be subject to criminal liability in many countries in burma indonesia malaysia the philippines and thailand there is an ancient tradition of attempting abortion through forceful abdominal massage reported methods of unsafe self induced abortion include the misuse of the ulcer drug misoprostol and the insertion of non surgical implements such as knitting needles and clothes hangers into the uterus health effects early term surgical abortion is a simple procedure and when performed by competent doctors and in some states nurse practitioners nurse midwives and physician assistants in first world nations before the one six th week is safer than carrying the pregnancy to term as with most surgical procedures the most common surgical abortion methods carry the risk of potentially serious complications these risks include a perforated uterus perforated bowel or bladder septic shock sterility and death the risk of complications occurring can increase depending on how far the pregnancy has progressed but may be counterbalanced by complications that would occur from carrying the pregnancy to term it is difficult to accurately assess the risks of induced abortion due to a number of factors these factors include wide variation in the quality of abortion services in different societies and among different socio economic groups a lack of uniform definitions of terms and difficulties in patient follow up and after care the degree of risk is also dependent upon the skill and experience of the practitioner maternal age health and parity gestational age pre existing conditions methods and instruments used medications used the skill and experience of those assisting the practitioner and the quality of recovery and follow up care a highly skilled practitioner operating under ideal conditions will tend to have a very low rate of complications an inexperienced practitioner in an ill equipped and ill staffed facility on the other hand will often have a higher incidence of complications in the united kingdom the number of deaths due to legal abortion between the years of one nine nine one and one nine nine three was five as compared to the nine deaths caused by ectopic pregnancy during the same time frame in the united states during the year one nine nine nine there were a total of four deaths due to legal abortion some practitioners advocate using minimal anesthesia so that the patient can alert them to possible complications others recommend general anesthesia in order to prevent patient movement which might cause a perforation general anesthesia carries its own risks including death which is why public health officials recommend against its routine use dilation of the cervix carries the risk of cervical tears or perforations including small tears that might not be apparent and might cause cervical incompetence in future pregnancies most practitioners recommend using the smallest possible dilators and using osmotic rather than mechanical dilators after the first trimester of pregnancy instruments are placed within the uterus to remove the fetus these can on rare occasions cause perforation or laceration of the uterus and damage to structures surrounding the uterus laceration or perforation of the uterus or cervix can again on rare occasions lead to even more serious complications incomplete emptying of the uterus can cause hemorrhage and infection use of ultrasound verification of the location and duration of the pregnancy prior to abortion with immediate follow up of patients reporting continuing pregnancy symptoms after the procedure will virtually eliminate this risk the sooner a complication is noted and properly treated the lower the risk of permanent injury or death in rare cases the abortion will be unsuccessful and the pregnancy will continue an unsuccessful abortion can also result in the delivery of a live neonate or infant this termed a failed abortion is more likely to occur if the procedure is carried out later in the pregnancy some doctors faced with this situation have voiced concerns about the ethical and legal ramifications of then letting the neonate die as a result recent investigations have been launched in the united kingdom by the confidential enquiry into maternal and child health cemach and the royal college of obstetricians and gynecologists in order to determine how widespread the problem is and what an ethical response in the treatment of the infant might be use of other methods e g overdose of various drugs insertion of various objects into uterus for abortion is potentially dangerous carrying a significantly elevated risk for permanent injury or death compared to abortions done by physicians suggested effects there is controversy over a number of proposed risks and effects of abortion evidence whether in support of or against such claims might in part be influenced by the political and religious beliefs of the parties behind it breast cancer the abortion breast cancer abc hypothesis posits a causal relationship between having an induced abortion and a higher risk of developing breast cancer in the future an increased level of estrogen in early pregnancy helps to initiate cellular differentiation growth in the breast in preparation for lactation if this process is terminated through abortion before full differentiation in the third trimester then more vulnerable undifferentiated cells will be left than there were prior to the pregnancy it is proposed that this might result in an elevated risk of breast cancer the majority of interview based studies have indicated a link and some have been demonstrated to be statistically significant but there remains debate as to their reliability because of possible response bias larger and more recent record based studies such as one in one nine nine seven which used data from two national registries in denmark found the correlation to be negligible to non existent after statistical adjustment the national cancer institute conducted an official workshop with dozens of experts on the issue between february two four february two six two zero zero three which concluded from its examination of various evidence that it is well established that induced abortion is not associated with an increase in breast cancer risk these findings and how the denmark study statistically adjusted their overall results have been disputed by dr joel brind an invitee to the workshop and the leading scientific advocate of the abortion breast cancer hypothesis nevertheless gaps and inconsistencies remain in the research and the subject continues to be one of political and scientific contention fetal pain the experience of the fetus during abortion is a matter of medical ethical and public policy concern evidence is conflicting with some authorities holding that the fetus is capable of feeling pain from the first trimester and others maintaining that the neuro anatomical requirements for such experience do not exist until the second or third trimester pain receptors begin to appear in the seventh week of pregnancy the thalamus the part of the brain which receives signals from the nervous system and then relays them to the cerebral cortex starts to form in the fifth week however other anatomical structures involved in the nociceptic process are not present until much later in gestation links between the thalamus and cerebral cortex aren t forged until around the two three rd week researchers have observed changes in the heart rates and hormonal levels of newborn infants after circumcision blood tests and surgery effects which were alleviated with the administration of anesthesia others suggest that the human experience of pain being more than just physiological cannot be measured in such reflexive responses mental health some women will experience negative feelings as a result of elective abortion however whether this phenomenon is significant enough to warrant a general diagnosis or even classification as an independent syndrome see post abortion syndrome is a subject that is debated among members of the medical community data on the incidence of clinical depression mental illness post traumatic stress disorder and suicide in association with abortion remain inconclusive a comparative analysis of the suicide rates among postpartum and post abortive women in finland found a statistical correlation between abortion and suicide other studies have suggested a link between the elective termination of an unwanted pregnancy and an improvement in reported mental well being elective abortion may reduce the occurrence of depression in cases of unwanted pregnancy as compared to cases in which the pregnancy has been carried to completion but it is also sometimes reported as an additional stressor ibid the majority of evidence would seem to indicate that adverse emotional reactions to the procedure are most strongly influenced by pre existing psychological conditions and other negative factors ibid spontaneous abortion or miscarriage is known to present an increased risk of depression in women history of abortion bottom most dr caton s tansy pills an example of a clandestine advertisement the practice of induced abortion according to some anthropologists can be traced to ancient times there is evidence to suggest that historically pregnancies were terminated through a number of methods including the administration of abortifacient herbs the use of sharpened implements the application of abdominal pressure and other techniques soranus a two nd century greek physician suggested in his work gynecology that women wishing to abort their pregnancies should engage in violent exercise energetic jumping carrying heavy objects and riding animals he also prescribed a number of recipes for herbal bathes pessaries and bloodletting but advised against the use of sharp instruments to induce miscarriage due to the risk of organ perforation it is also known that the ancient greeks relied upon the herb silphium as both a contraceptive and an abortifacient the plant as the chief export of cyrene was driven to extinction but it is suggested that it might have possessed the same abortive properties as some of its closest extant relatives in the apiaceae family such folk remedies however varied in effectiveness and were not without risk tansy and pennyroyal for example are two poisonous herbs with serious side effects that have at times been used to terminate pregnancy one nine th century medicine saw advances in the fields of surgery anaesthesia and sanitation in the same era that doctors with the american medical association lobbied for bans on abortion in the united states and the british parliament passed the offences against the person act demand for the procedure continued however as the disguised but nonetheless open advertisement of abortion services in victorian times would seem to suggest social issues a number of of complex issues exist in the debate over abortion these like the suggested effects upon health listed above are a focus of research and a fixture of discussion among members on all sides the controversy effect upon crime rate a controversial theory attempts to draw a correlation between the unprecedented nationwide decline of the overall crime rate witnessed in the united states during the one nine nine zero s and the decriminalization of abortion two zero years prior the suggestion was brought to widespread attention by a one nine nine nine academic paper the impact of legalized abortion on crime authored by the economists steven d levitt and john donohue they attributed the drop in crime to a reduction in individuals said to have a higher statistical probability of committing crimes unwanted children especially those born to mothers who are african american impoverished adolescent uneducated and single the change coincided with what would ve been the adolescence or peak years of potential criminality of those who had not been born as a result of roe v wade and similar cases donohue and levitt s study also noted that states which legalized abortion before the rest of the nation experienced the lowering crime rate pattern earlier and that those with higher abortion rates had more pronounced reductions fellow economists christopher foote and christopher goetz criticized the methodology in the donahue levitt study noting a lack of accommodation for statewide yearly variations such as cocaine use and recalculating based on incidence of crime per capita they found no statistically significant results levitt and donohue responded to this by presenting an adjusted data set which took into account these concerns but they claim maintained the statistical significance of their initial paper such research has been criticized by some as being utilitarian discriminatory as to race and socioeconomic class and as promoting eugenics as a solution to crime levitt states in his book freakonomics that they are neither promoting nor negating any course of action merely reporting data as economists sex selective abortion the advent of both ultrasound and amniocentesis has allowed parents to determine sex before birth this has lead to the occurrence of sex selective abortion or the targeted termination of a fetus based upon its gender it is suggested that sex selective abortion might be partially responsible for the noticeable disparities between the birth rates of male and female children in some places the preference for male children is reported in many areas of asia and the use of abortion to limit female births has been reported in mainland china taiwan south korea and india in india the economic role of men the costs associated with dowries and a hindu tradition which dictates that funeral rites must be performed by a male relative have lead to a cultural preference for sons the widespread availability of diagnostic testing during the one nine seven zero s and eight zero s lead to advertisements for services which read invest five zero zero rupees for a sex test now save five zero zero zero zero rupees for a dowry later in one nine nine one the male to female sex ratio in india was skewed from its biological norm of one zero five to one zero zero to an average of one zero eight to one zero zero researchers have asserted that between one nine eight five and two zero zero five as many as one zero million female fetuses may have been selectively aborted the indian government passed an official ban of pre natal sex screening in one nine nine four and moved to pass a complete ban of sex selective abortion in two zero zero two in the people s republic of china there is also a historic son preference the implementation of the one child policy in one nine seven nine in response to population concerns lead to an increased disparities in the sex ratio as parents attempted to circumvent the law through sex selective abortion or the abandonment of unwanted daughters sex selective abortion might be a part of what is behind the shift from the baseline male to female birth rate to an elevated national rate of one one seven one zero zero reported in two zero zero two the trend was more pronounced in rural regions as high as one three zero one zero zero in guangdong and one three five one zero zero in hainan a ban upon the practice of sex selective abortion was enacted in two zero zero three unsafe abortion where and when access to safe abortion has been barred due to explicit sanctions or general unavailability women seeking to terminate their pregnancies have sometimes resorted to unsafe methods back alley abortion is a slang term for any abortion not practiced under ideal conditions of sanitation and professionalism the world health organization defines an unsafe abortion as being a procedure carried out by persons lacking the necessary skills or in an environment that does not conform to minimal medical standards or both this can include a person without medical training a professional health provider operating in sub standard conditions or the woman herself unsafe abortion remains a public health concern today due to the higher incidence and severity of its associated complications such as incomplete abortion sepsis hemorrhage and damage to internal organs who estimates that one nine million unsafe abortions occur around the world annually and that six eight zero zero zero of these result in the death of a woman complications of unsafe abortion are said to account globally for approximately one three of all maternal mortalities with regional estimates including one two in asia two five in latin america and one three in sub saharan africa health education access to family planning and improvements in healthcare during and after abortion have been proposed to address this phenomenon abortion debate pro life activists in washington dc stage a silent demonstration before the supreme court over the course of the history of abortion induced abortions have been a source of considerable debate and controversy regarding the morality and legality of this practice an individual s position on the complex ethical moral philosophical biological and legal issues have a strong relationship with that individual s value system a person s position on abortion may be best described as a combination of their personal beliefs on the morality of abortion and that person s beliefs on the ethical scope and responsibility of legitimate governmental and legal authority another factor for many individuals is religious doctrine see religion and abortion abortion debates especially pertaining to abortion laws are often spearheaded by advocacy groups belonging to one of two camps most often those in favor of legal prohibition of abortion describe themselves as pro life while those against legal restrictions on abortion describe themselves as pro choice both are used to indicate the central principles in arguments for and against abortion is the fetus a human being with a fundamental right to life for pro life advocates and for those who are pro choice does a woman have the right to choose whether or not to have an abortion in both public and private debate arguments presented in favor of or against abortion focus on either the moral permissibility of an induced abortion or justification of laws permitting or restricting abortion arguments on morality and legality tend to collide and combine complicating the issue at hand debate also focuses on whether the pregnant woman should have to notify and or have the consent of others in distinct cases a minor her parents a legally married or common law wife her husband or a pregnant woman the biological father in a two zero zero three gallup poll in the united states seven two of respondents were in favor of spousal notification with two six opposed of those polled seven nine of males and six seven of females responded in favor public opinion

be obtained often but not always using a trimester based system to regulate the window in which abortion is still legal to perform in the united states some states impose a two four hour waiting period before the procedure prescribe the distribution of information on fetal development or require that parents be contacted if their minor daughter requests an abortion in the united kingdom as in some other countries two doctors must first certify that an abortion is medically or socially necessary before it can be performed other countries in which abortion is illegal will allow one to be

the ball used in american football has a pointed oval or vesica piscis shape and usually has a large set of stitches along one side american football known in the united states simply as football is a competitive team sport the object of the game is to advance the football towards the opposing team s end zone and score points the ball can be advanced by carrying the ball or by throwing or handing it from one teammate to the other points can be scored in a variety of ways including carrying the ball over the goal line throwing the ball to another player past the goal line or kicking it through the goal posts the winner is the team with the most points when the time expires outside of the united states and a few other countries such as american samoa the sport is usually referred to as american football or sometimes as gridiron to differentiate it from other football games especially association football soccer and rugby football american football evolved as a separate sport from rugby football in the late one nine th century arena football is a variant of american football in canada the unqualified term football typically refers to canadian football a game which is a close relative of american football but different in several respects popularity since the one nine six zero s football has surpassed baseball as the most popular spectator sport in the united states the three two team national football league nfl is the most popular and only major professional american football league its championship game the super bowl is watched by nearly half of us television households and is also televised in over one five zero other countries super bowl sunday has become an annual ritual in late january or early february football is also the most watched sport on television in the us the nfl also operates a developmental league nfl europe with six teams based in european cities a colorado state university player runs with the ball as an air force academy player lines up a tackle college football is also extremely popular throughout the u s especially in markets not served by an nfl team several college football stadiums seat more than one zero zero zero zero zero fans which regularly sell out even high school football games can attract five figure crowds especially in hotbeds like western pennsylvania nebraska florida georgia and most especially texas ohio and california the weekly autumn ritual of college and high school football which includes marching bands cheerleaders and parties including the ubiquitous tailgate party is an important part of the culture in much of smalltown america it is a long standing tradition in the united states though not universally observed that high school football games are played on friday college games on saturday and professional games on sunday with an additional professional game on monday nights see monday night football it is often said of an outstanding college football player that he is likely to be playing on sundays one day meaning that he is a good pro prospect certain fall and winter holidays most notably thanksgiving christmas and new years day have traditional football games associated with them football is also played recreationally by amateur club and youth teams e g the pop warner little league programs there are also many semi pro teams in leagues where the players are paid to play but at a small enough salary that they generally must also hold a full time job pro football is played only in the united states and in the above mentioned nfl europe league the sport is popular as an amateur activity in mexico and american samoa and to a lesser extent in japan europe and australia a very similar sport canadian football is widely played in canada organized football is played almost exclusively by men and boys although a few amateur and semi professional women s leagues have begun play in recent years the rules of american football the object of american football is to score more points than the opposing team within a set time limit field and players the numbers on the field indicate the number of yards to the nearest end zone the field is often called the gridiron because the markings on the field resemble a grill the game is played on a rectangular field one two zero yards one one zero metres long by five three one three yards four nine metres wide the longer boundary lines are sidelines while the shorter boundary lines are end lines near each end of the field is a goal line they are one zero zero yards apart a scoring area called an end zone extends one zero yards beyond each goal line to each end line yard lines cross the field every five yards and are numbered from each goal line to the five zero yard line or midfield similar to a typical rugby league field two rows of lines known as hash marks parallel the side lines near the middle of the field all plays start with the ball on or between the hash marks at the back of each end zone are two goal posts also called uprights that are one eight five feet apart the posts are connected by a crossbar one zero feet from the ground successful kicks must go above the crossbar and between the uprights at many fields the uprights and crossbar are attached by a curved bar to a post outside the field of play to reduce the chance of players running into the supports each team has one one players on the field at a time however teams may substitute for any or all of their players between plays as a result players have very specialized roles and almost all of the five three players on an nfl team will play in any given game thus teams are divided into three separate units the offense the defense and the special teams see below in the nfl players jersey numbers are distributed according to a strict system e g quarterbacks always wear between one one nine game duration a standard football game consists of four one five minute typically one two minutes in high school football periods called quarters with an intermission called halftime after the second quarter the clock stops after certain plays therefore a game can last considerably longer often more than three hours in real time if an nfl game is tied after four quarters the teams play up to another one five minutes in an nfl overtime game the first team that scores wins if neither team scores the game is a tie college overtime rules are more complicated and are described at overtime sport advancing the ball advancing the ball in american football resembles the six tackle rule and the play the ball in rugby league football the team that takes possession of the ball the offense has four attempts called downs to advance the ball one zero yards towards their opponent s the defense s end zone when the offense gains one zero yards it gets a first down or another set of four downs to gain one zero yards if the offense fails to gain a first down one zero yards after four downs it loses possession of the ball except at the beginning of halves and after scores see kickoffs and free kicks below the ball is always put into play by a snap all players line up facing each other at the line of scrimmage the position on the field where the play begins one offensive player the center then passes or snaps the ball between his legs to a teammate usually the quarterback players can then advance the ball in two ways by running with the ball also known as rushing one ball carrier can hand the ball to another this is known as a handoff by throwing the ball to a teammate known as passing the forward pass is a key factor distinguishing american and canadian football from other football sports the offense can throw the ball forward only once on a play and only from behind the line of scrimmage the ball can be thrown sideways or backwards at any time this type of pass is known as a lateral and is much rarer in american football than in rugby league or rugby union where a backwards pass is mandatory a play or down ends and the ball becomes dead after any of the following the player with the ball is forced to the ground or has his forward progress halted by members of the other team as determined by an official a forward pass flies out of bounds or touches the ground before it is caught this is known as an incomplete pass the ball is returned to the original line of scrimmage for the next down the ball or the player with the ball goes beyond the dimensions of the field out of bounds a team scores a certain penalty is committed such as false start that causes the play to be blown dead and replayed officials blow a whistle to notify all players that the play is over at all times players and fans must be aware of the sequence of downs and the distance to a new first down when a team has a first down the scoreboard or television screen flashes one st and one zero that is first down and one zero yards to go if the team gains three yards on the first play for example the next down will be two nd and seven changes of possession the offense maintains possession of the ball unless one of the following things happens the team fails to get a first down that is move the ball forward at least one zero yards in four downs the defensive team takes over the ball at the spot where the play ends a change of possession in this manner is commonly called a turnover on downs the offense scores a touchdown or field goal the team that scored then kicks off the ball to the other team see scoring and kickoffs below the offense punts the ball to the defense a punt is a kick in which a player drops the ball and kicks it before it hits the ground punts are nearly always made on fourth down when the offensive team does not want to risk giving up the ball to the other team at its current spot on the field through a failed attempt to make a first down and feels it is too far from the other team s goal posts to kick a field goal a defensive player catches a forward pass this is called an interception and the player who makes the interception can run with the ball until tackled forced out of bounds or scores after the intercepting player is tackled or forced out of bounds his team s offensive unit returns to the field and takes over at his last position an offensive player drops the ball a fumble and a defensive player picks it up as with interceptions a player recovering a fumble can run with the ball until tackled or forced out of bounds lost fumbles and interceptions are together known as turnovers the offensive team misses a field goal attempt the defensive team gets the ball at the spot where the previous play began or in the nfl at the spot of the kick if the unsuccessful kick was attempted from within two zero yards of the end zone the other team gets the ball at its own two zero yard line that is two zero yards from the end zone an offensive player is tackled forced out of bounds or commits certain penalties in his own end zone this rare occurrence is called a safety see scoring below scoring a team scores points by the following plays a touchdown td is worth six points a touchdown is scored when a player runs the ball into or catches a pass in his opponent s end zone after a touchdown the scoring team attempts a conversion the ball is placed at the other team s three yard line the two yard line in the nfl the team can attempt to kick it over the crossbar and through the goal posts in the manner of a field goal for one point an extra point or run or pass it into the end zone in the manner of a touchdown for two points a two point conversion in collegiate and professional leagues the extra point is usually preferred its success rate is nine four in the nfl and nine three eight in the ncaa compared to four three in the nfl and four three five in the ncaa for two point conversions if the defense forces a turnover on an attempted conversion and runs the ball back to their opponent s endzone they are awarded with two points does not apply in the nfl a field goal fg is worth three points and it is scored by kicking the ball over the crossbar and through the goal posts field goals may be placekicked kicked when the ball is held vertically against the ground by a teammate or drop kicked a field goal is usually attempted on fourth down instead of a punt when the ball is close to the goal line or when there is little or no time left to otherwise score a safety is worth two points a safety is scored by the defense when the offensive player in possession of the ball is forced back into his own end zone and is tackled there or fumbles the ball out of the end zone certain penalties by the offense occurring in the end zone also result in a safety kickoffs and free kicks each half begins with a kickoff teams also kick off after scoring touchdowns and field goals the ball is kicked from a kicking tee which is made from one s own three zero yard line in the nfl and from the three five yard line in college football the other team s kick returner tries to catch the ball and advance it as far as possible where he is stopped is the point where the offense will begin its drive or series of offensive plays if a kick returner does not want to run with the ball he has the option to signal for a fair catch by waving his hands in the air before the catch he will then be allowed to catch the ball and kneel it down on the field without being tackled if the kick returner catches the ball in his own end zone he can either run with the ball or elect for a touchback by kneeling in the end zone the receiving team can then start its offensive drive from its own two zero yard line a touchback can also occur when the kick goes out of the end zone punts and turnovers in the end zone can also end in touchbacks if a kickoff goes out of bounds over the sidelines without being interfered by the receiving team the ball will be placed three zero yards from the spot of the kickoff traditionally at the receiving team s four zero yard line in the nfl or the three five yard line in college football after safeties there is a free kick instead of a kickoff a free kick is made from a team s own two zero yard line and can be punted or placekicked penalties rule violations are punished with penalties most penalties result in moving the football either towards the endzone in the case of a defensive penalty or away from the endzone in the case of an offensive penalty some defensive penalties give the offense an automatic first down in addition if a penalty gives the offensive team enough yardage to gain a first down the first down is automatically given if a penalty occurs during a play an official throws a yellow flag near the spot of the foul when the play is over the team that did not commit the penalty has the option of taking either the penalty or the result of the play for example say a defensive player commits an offsides penalty on first down by passing the line of scrimmage before the snap and the offense gains eight yards on the play the team with the ball has the option of taking the penalty and repeat the first down with five yards to go or declining the penalty and scrimmaging with two nd and two some common penalties false start a player on the offense other than a back moving parallel to the line of scrimmage moves just prior to the snap five yards offsides a player is on the wrong side of the ball at the start of a play five yards similar fouls touching an opponent before the snap is encroachment lining up alongside the football instead of behind it is a neutral zone infraction holding a blocker unfairly impedes a would be tackler or pass receiver by grabbing the player s jersey hooking or tackling when commited by the offense or by either team on a change of possession the penalty is ten yards when committed by the defense the penalty is five yards and an automatic first down is awarded to the offense if the penalty occurred beyond the line of scrimmage the penalty would be enforced from the spot of the foul pass interference after a pass is launched into the air a defender pushes hooks grabs or knocks down a would be pass receiver or if the receiver does the same to the defender to prevent an interception first down at the spot of the foul if against the defense one five yards from the previous spot in college football or ten yards from the previous spot if against the offense similar penalties before a pass are called as holding or illegal contact facemask a player places his hand on an opponent s facemask during a play five yards or fifteen a personal foul if the player hooks his fingers into the facemask or pulls on it roughing the passer kicker a player places a hard hit on a passer long enough after a pass has been thrown to consider the contact avoidable or places a hard hit on a punter or place kicker fifteen yards and automatic first down running into the kicker a lighter contact on a kicker especially after the kick has been made five yards intentional grounding the passer throws a forward pass not near any eligible receiver without first leaving the area behind where the blocking linemen were standing before the snap the pocket or the passer throws a forward pass outside of the pocket which does not reach the original line of scrimmage and is not near any eligible receiver ten yards plus loss of down except if the penalty occurred in the end zone then it is ruled a safety and the defense is awarded two points in college football and high school football the defense is also credited with a quarterback sack note that spiking the ball to stop the clock is exempt from this ineligible receiver downfield on every play the offense must have seven players on the line of scrimmage the player furthest from the ball on each side are eligible receivers the interior five players are considered ineligible to receive passes this penalty is called if one of the five interior players is more than five yards past the line of scrimmage during a forward pass dead ball personal foul after the play is blown dead a player tackles or makes rough contact with a player on the other team fifteen yards automatic first down if on defense unnecessary roughness a catch all for rough play that doesn t merit its own foul an example is an avoidable late hit on a ball carrier who has run out of bounds fifteen yards unsportsmanlike conduct another catch all call commonly used for taunting excessive celebration after a touchdown and certain banned forms of pantomime like slashing the throat fifteen yards the players as noted above most football players have highly specialized roles at the college and nfl levels most play only offense or only defense offense the offensive line consists of five players whose job is to protect the passer and clear the way for runners by blocking members of the defense except for the center offensive linemen generally do not handle the ball the quarterback receives the ball on most plays he then hands or tosses it to a running back throws it to a receiver or runs with it himself running backs line up behind or beside the qb and specialize in rushing with the ball they also block catch passes and on rare occasions pass the ball to others wide receivers line up near the sidelines they specialize in catching passes tight ends line up outside the offensive line they can either play like wide receivers try to catch passes or like offensive linemen protect the qb or create spaces for runners not all of these types of players will be in on every offensive play teams can vary the number of wide receivers tight ends and running backs on the field at one time defense the defensive line consists of three to five players who line up across from the offensive line they try to tackle the running backs before they can gain yardage or the quarterback before he can throw a pass at least three players line up as defensive backs they cover the receivers and try to stop pass completions they occasionally rush the quarterback the other players on the defense are known as linebackers they line up between the defensive line and backs and may either rush the quarterback or cover potential receivers special teams the units of players who handle kicking plays are known as special teams special teams feature players that include the punter who handles punts and the placekicker or kicker who kicks off and attempts field goals and extra points basic football strategy to many fans the chief draw of football is the chess game that goes on between the two coaching staffs each team has a playbook of dozens to hundreds of plays plays are the directions for what the players should do on a down some plays are very safe they are very likely to get a few yards but not much more than that other plays have the potential for long gains but a greater risk of a loss of yardage or a turnover generally speaking rushing plays are less risky than passing plays however there are relatively safe passing plays and risky running plays to fool the other team there are passing plays designed to look like running plays and vice versa there are many trick or gadget plays such as when a team lines up like it is going to kick and then tries to run or pass for a first down such high risk plays are a great thrill to the fans when they work however they can spell disaster if the opposing team realizes the deception and acts accordingly it has been said that football is the closest sport that strategically resembles real war which may explain why it is by far the most popular sport in the american military in fact the united states military academy the united states naval academy and the united states air force academy each field football teams that participate in division i a of the ncaa army and navy have a particularly historic rivalry a physical game american football is a collision sport to stop the offense from advancing the ball the defense must tackle the player with the ball by knocking him down as such defensive players must use some form of physical contact to bring the ball carrier to the ground within certain rules and guidelines tacklers cannot kick punch or trip the runner they also cannot grab the face mask of the runner s helmet lead into a tackle with their own helmet or lift the ball carrier up off his feet and drop him despite these and other rules regarding unnecessary roughness most other forms of tackling are legal blockers and defenders trying to evade them also have wide leeway in trying to force their opponents out of the way quarterbacks are regularly hit by defenders coming on full speed from outside the quarterback s field of vision the high level of physical contact in football makes it more dangerous than other major american team sports to compensate for this players must wear a good deal of special protective equipment such as a padded plastic helmet shoulder pads hip pads and knee pads these protective paddings were introduced decades ago and improved ever since to help minimize lasting injury to players despite protective equipment and rule changes to emphasize safety injuries remain very common in football due to its physical nature twenty five football players mostly high schoolers died from injuries directly related to football from two zero zero zero two zero zero four according to the national center for catastrophic sport injury research concussions are common with an estimated six two zero zero zero suffered every year among high school players according to the brain injury association of arizona it is common to see injuries in the game and deaths are not unheard of the game is particularly risky when played by amateurs without proper gear such as is common amongst americans in backyards and parks across the country some have criticized american football as a violent sport american football is indeed quite physical in comparison to sports like basketball and soccer as well as other major american team sports tackle football is often banned in american schoolyards in favor of touch football which uses two hand touching instead of tackling or flag football in which a player is tackled when an opponent pulls a flag off a belt attached to the player s waist school physical education classes often use the two hand touch version of the game leaving the tackles to the school s official after school sports program which can provide the appropriate gear and supervision the level of physical aggression and risk of injury has also made football less appealing to females as they generally lack the muscle and body mass to compete without serious risk the tackle nature of football also tends to favor the largest and strongest players along with the fastest the average weight of players in the nfl has increased in recent years all these factors have brought the sport into controversy in the past few decades joining the group of other violent and thus controversial sports such as dodgeball wrestling hockey and boxing critics argue that these sports emphasize size physical strength and brute force and breed aggression and unhealthy competitive attitudes in children others argue that such sports teach sportsmanship and teamwork and though contact sports are all violent to some degree they always emphasize skill and strategy over mere belligerence development of the game both american football and soccer have their origins in varieties of football played in the united kingdom in the mid one nine th century and american football is directly descended from rugby football rugby was first introduced to north america in canada brought by the british army garrison in montreal which played a series of games with mcgill university both canadian and american football evolved from this point for an in depth overview of the differences and similarities of canadian football and american football see comparison of canadian and american football american colleges spearheaded the growth of football the first inter collegiate football game was played between rutgers and princeton universities on november six one eight six nine the game was won by rutgers six four although the game which bore little resemblance to its modern day counterpart was played with two teams of two five men each under rugby like rules but like modern football it was replete with surprise strategy prodigies of determination and physical prowess to use the words of one of the rutgers players rutgers football american football in its current form grew out of a series of three games between harvard university and mcgill university of montreal in one eight seven four mcgill played rugby football while harvard played the boston game which was closer to soccer as often happened in those days of far from universal rules the teams alternated rules so that both would have a fair chance the harvard players liked having the opportunity to run with the ball and in one eight seven five persuaded yale university to adopt rugby rules for their annual game in one eight seven six yale harvard princeton and columbia formed the intercollegiate football association which used the rugby code except for a slight difference in scoring in one eight eight zero walter camp introduced the scrimmage in place of the rugby scrum in one eight eight two the system of downs was introduced to thwart princeton s and yale s strategy of controlling the ball without trying to score in one eight eight three the number of players was reduced at camp s urging to eleven and camp introduced the soon standard arrangement of a seven man offensive line with a quarterback two halfbacks and a fullback on september three one eight nine five the first professional football game was played in latrobe pennsylvania between the latrobe ymca and the jeannette athletic club latrobe won the contest one two zero by the one eight nine zero s interlocking offensive formations such as the flying wedge and the practice of teammates physically dragging ball carrying players forward had made the game extremely dangerous despite restrictions on the flying wedge and other precautions in one nine zero five eighteen players were killed in games president theodore roosevelt informed the universities that the game must be made safer to force them to respond to his concerns he threatened to pressure congress to make playing football a federal crime in one nine zero six two rival organizing bodies the intercollegiate rules committee and the intercollegiate athletic association met in new york eventually they agreed on several new rules intended to make the game safer among them the addition of a neutral zone between the scrimmage lines and a requirement that at least six players from each team line up on them the most far reaching innovation they considered though was the legalization of the forward pass this was very controversial at the time much derided by purists as an alternative means of opening out the play walter camp would have preferred widening the field but representatives from harvard pointed to recently constructed harvard stadium which could not be widened and the forward pass was adopted it has come to shape the whole history of american football as opposed to its cousins around the world in one nine one zero after further deaths interlocking formations were finally outlawed and in one nine one two the field was changed to its current size the value of a touchdown increased to six points and a fourth down added to each possession the game had achieved its modern form problems in football injuries are more common in american football than in many other sports although rule changes made in the past nine zero years for instance the elimination of horse collar tackles have gradually lowered the rates of injuries in addition protective equipment has become better for example the optional leather helmets introduced during the one eight nine zero s have been replaced in several stages by required high tech padded plastic helmets with bars protecting the face more recently the use of steroids and the extent thereof has become an object of debate in professional college and even high school football leagues another problem with football is that it is an expensive sport the specialized helmets uniforms and pads can cost hundreds of dollars there is a widespread perception that football teams based in schools and public recreational leagues consume far more than their fair share of the sports budget although sales of tickets to college and to some extent high school football games often make it a revenue producing sport cleveland browns stadium in cleveland ohio home of the

the american revolution it was fought primarily between great britain and revolutionaries within thirteen british colonies in north america who proclaimed themselves as the united states of america early in the war the war began largely as a colonial revolt against the economic policies of the british empire and eventually widened far beyond british north america with france spain and the netherlands entering the war against great britain additionally many native americans fought on both sides of the conflict throughout the war the british were able to use their naval superiority to capture and occupy coastal cities but control of the countryside where most of the population lived largely eluded them french involvement proved decisive with a naval victory in the chesapeake leading to the surrender of a british army at the battle of yorktown in one seven eight one the treaty of paris in one seven eight three recognized the independence of the united states of america the terms american revolutionary war and american revolution are often used interchangeably though the american revolution included political and social developments before and after the war itself this article refers solely to the military campaign for a broader perspective including the origins and aftermath of the war see the article on the american revolution combatants choosing sides colonists were divided over which side to support in the war in some areas the struggle was a civil war the revolutionaries also known as americans or patriots had the support of about four zero to four five percent of the colonial population about one five to two zero percent of the population supported the british crown during the war and were known as loyalists or tories loyalists fielded perhaps five zero zero zero zero men during the war years in support of the british empire after the war some seven zero zero zero zero loyalists departed most going to canada great britain or to british colonies in the caribbean when the war began the americans did not have a professional army also known as a standing army each colony had traditionally provided for its own defenses through the use of local militia militiamen served for only a few weeks or months at a time were generally reluctant to go very far from home and would often come and go as they saw fit militia typically lacked the training and discipline of regular troops but could be effective when an emergency energized them seeking to coordinate military efforts the continental congress established on paper a regular army the continental army in june one seven seven five and appointed george washington as commander in chief the development of the continental army was always a work in progress and washington reluctantly augmented the regular troops with militia throughout the war although as many as two five zero zero zero zero men may have served as regulars or as militiamen for the revolutionary cause in the eight years of the war there were never more than nine zero zero zero zero total men under arms for the americans in any given year armies in north america were small by european standards of the era the greatest number of men that washington personally commanded in the field at any one time was fewer than one seven zero zero zero european nations german troops serving with the british in north america c ziegler after conrad gessner one seven nine nine early in one seven seven five the british army consisted of about three six zero zero zero men worldwide but wartime recruitment steadily increased this number additionally over the course of the war the british hired about three zero zero zero zero german mercenaries popularly known in the colonies as hessians because many of them came from hesse kassel germans would make up about one third of the british troop strength in north america by one seven seven nine the number of british and german troops stationed in north america was over six zero zero zero zero though these were spread from canada to florida france the netherlands and spain entered the war against great britain in an attempt to dilute britain s emerging superpower status early on all three countries quietly provided financial assistance to the american rebels france officially entered the war in one seven seven eight and soon sent troops ships and military equipment to fight against the british for the remainder of the war spain entered the war in one seven seven nine officially as an ally of france but not the united states spain was not keen on encouraging similar rebellions in her own empire the netherlands entered the war late in one seven eight zero but was soon overwhelmed by the british blacks and native americans african americans slaves and free blacks served on both sides during the war black soldiers served in northern militias from the outset but this was forbidden in the south where slaveowners feared arming slaves lord dunmore the royal governor of virginia issued an emancipation proclamation in november one seven seven five promising freedom to runaway slaves who fought for the british sir henry clinton issued a similar edict in new york in one seven seven nine tens of thousands of slaves escaped to the british lines although possibly as few as one zero zero zero served under arms many of the rest served as orderlies mechanics laborers servants scouts and guides although more than half died in smallpox epidemics that swept the british forces and a number were driven out of the british lines when food ran low despite dunmore s promises the majority were not given their freedom in response and because of manpower shortages washington lifted the ban on black enlistment in the continental army in january one seven seven six all black units were formed in rhode island and massachusetts many were slaves promised freedom for serving in lieu of their masters another all black unit came from haiti with french forces at least five zero zero zero black soldiers fought for the patriot cause most american indian communities east of the mississippi river were affected by the war many divided over the question of which side to support most native americans who joined the fight fought against the united states since native lands were threatened by expanding american settlement an estimated one three zero zero zero warriors fought on the british side the largest group the iroquois confederacy fielded about one five zero zero warriors against the americans war in the north massachusetts one seven seven four to one seven seven six map of campaigns in the revolutionary war in one seven seven four the british parliament effectively abolished the provincial government of massachusetts lieutenant general thomas gage already the commander in chief of british troops in north america was also appointed governor of massachusetts and was instructed by king george s government to enforce royal authority in the troublesome colony however popular resistance compelled the newly appointed royal officials in massachusetts to resign or to seek refuge in boston gage commanded four regiments of british regulars about four zero zero zero men from his headquarters in boston but the countryside was in the hands of the revolutionaries on the night of april one eight one seven seven five general gage sent nine zero zero men to seize munitions stored by the colonial militia at concord massachusetts several riders including paul revere alerted the countryside and when the british troops entered lexington on the morning of april one nine they found seven five minutemen formed up on the village common shots were exchanged and the british moved on to concord where there was more fighting by the time the redcoats as the british soldiers were called began the return march several thousand militiamen had gathered along the road a running fight ensued and the british detachment suffered heavily with the battle of lexington and concord the shot heard round the world the war had begun afterwards thousands of militiamen converged on boston bottling up the british in the city late in may gage received by sea about four five zero zero reinforcements and a trio of generals who would play a vital role in the war william howe john burgoyne and henry clinton they formulated a plan to break out of the city on june one seven one seven seven five british forces under general howe seized the charleston peninsula at the battle of bunker hill the battle was technically a british victory but losses were so heavy that the attack was not followed up thus the siege was not broken and general gage was soon replaced by general howe as the british commander in chief in july one seven seven five newly appointed general washington arrived outside boston to take charge of the colonial forces the standoff continued throughout the fall and winter in early march one seven seven six heavy cannons that had been captured by the revolutionaries at fort ticonderoga were moved to boston a difficult feat engineered by henry knox when the guns were placed on dorchester heights overlooking the british positions howe s situation became untenable the british evacuated the city on march one seven one seven seven six and sailed for temporary refuge in halifax nova scotia the local militia dispersed and in april washington took most of the continental army to fortify new york city canada one seven seven five to one seven seven six during the long standoff at boston the continental congress sought a way to seize the initiative elsewhere congress had initially invited french canadians to join them as the fourteenth colony but when that failed to happen an invasion of canada was authorized in an attempt to drive the british from the primarily francophone colony of quebec comprising present day quebec and ontario two expeditions were undertaken on september one six one seven seven five brigadier general richard montgomery marched north from fort ticonderoga with about one seven zero zero militiamen capturing montreal on november one three general guy carleton the governor of canada escaped to quebec city the second expedition led by colonel benedict arnold set out from fort western present day maine on september two five the expedition was a logistical nightmare and many men succumbed to smallpox by the time arnold reached quebec city in early november he had but six zero zero of his original one one zero zero men nevertheless arnold demanded the surrender of the city to no avail montgomery joined arnold and they attacked quebec city on december three one but were soundly defeated by carleton montgomery was killed arnold was wounded and many men were taken prisoner the americans held on outside quebec city until the spring of one seven seven six and then withdrew another attempt was made by the revolutionaries to push back towards quebec but failed at trois rivi res on june eight one seven seven six carleton then launched his own invasion and defeated arnold in the battle of valcour island in october arnold fell back to fort ticonderoga where the invasion of canada had begun the invasion of canada ended as an embarrassing disaster for the revolutionaries but arnold s improvised navy on lake champlain delayed the fateful british counter thrust the saratoga campaign until one seven seven seven new york and new jersey one seven seven six to one seven seven seven having withdrawn from boston the british now focused on capturing new york city general howe with the services of his brother admiral lord howe began amassing troops on staten island in july one seven seven six general washington with a smaller army of about two zero zero zero zero men unwittingly violated a cardinal rule of warfare and divided his troops about equally between long island and manhattan thus allowing the howes to engage only one half of the continental army at a time in late august the howes transported about two two zero zero zero men including nine zero zero zero hessians to long island in the battle of long island on august two seven one seven seven six the british expertly executed a surprise flanking maneuver driving the revolutionaries back to the brooklyn heights fortifications general howe then laid siege to the works but washington skillfully managed a nighttime evacuation to manhattan having taken long island the howes moved to seize manhattan on september one five general howe landed about one two zero zero zero men on lower manhattan quickly taking control of new york city the revolutionaries withdrew to harlem heights where they skirmished the next day but held their ground when howe moved to encircle washington s army in october the revolutionaries again fell back and a battle at white plains was fought on october two eight one seven seven six once more washington retreated but howe instead of aggressively pursuing the withdrawal returned to manhattan and captured fort washington in mid november taking almost three zero zero zero prisoners four days later fort lee across the hudson river from fort washington was also taken emanuel leutze s one eight five one painting washington crossing the delaware is an iconic image of american history general lord cornwallis continued to chase washington s army through new jersey until the revolutionaries withdrew across the delaware river into pennsylvania in early december with the campaign at an apparent conclusion for the season the british entered winter quarters although howe had missed several opportunities to crush the diminishing rebel army he had killed or captured over five zero zero zero americans he controlled much of new york and new jersey and was in a good position to resume operations in the spring with the rebel capital of philadelphia in striking distance the outlook of the continental army and thus the revolution itself was bleak these are the times that try men s souls wrote thomas paine who was with the army on the retreat the army had dwindled to fewer than five zero zero zero men fit for duty and would be reduced to one four zero zero after enlistments expired at the end of the year spirits were low popular support was wavering and congress had abandoned philadelphia in despair washington reacted by taking the offensive stealthily crossing the delaware on christmas night and capturing nearly one zero zero zero hessians at the battle of trenton on december two six one seven seven six cornwallis marched to retake trenton but was outmaneuvered by washington who successfully attacked the british rearguard at princeton on january three one seven seven seven washington then entered winter quarters at morristown new jersey having retaken much of new jersey and having secured two bold morale boosting victories in quick succession to reinvigorate the flagging revolution saratoga campaign one seven seven seven in the summer of one seven seven seven the british launched a new expedition from canada led by general burgoyne the intention was to seize the lake champlain and hudson river corridor effectively isolating new england from the rest of the american colonies burgoyne s invasion had two components he would lead about one zero zero zero zero men along lake champlain towards albany new york while a second column of about two zero zero zero men led by barry st leger would move down the mohawk river valley and link up with burgoyne in albany burgoyne set off in early july recapturing fort ticonderoga from the retreating revolutionaries without firing a shot he then proceeded overland towards albany but revolutionaries slowed his progress through the wilderness by destroying bridges and felling trees in his path running short on supplies in august burgoyne sent a detachment to raid nearby bennington vermont the raiders were decisively defeated by local militia depriving burgoyne of nearly one zero zero zero men and the much needed supplies the mohawk leader joseph brant commanded both american indians and white loyalists during the american revolutionary war meanwhile st leger half of his force american indians led by joseph brant had laid siege to fort stanwix on the mohawk river about eight zero zero revolutionary militiamen and their indian allies marched to relieve the siege but were ambushed and scattered by british and indians on august six at the battle of oriskany iroquois warriors fought on both sides of the battle marking the beginning of a civil war within the six nations when a second relief expedition approached this time led by benedict arnold the siege was lifted and st leger s expedition returned to canada burgoyne was on his own burgoyne pushed on towards albany his forces now reduced to about six zero zero zero men a revolutionary army of about eight zero zero zero men commanded by the newly arrived general horatio gates had entrenched about one zero miles one six km south of saratoga new york burgoyne sent two zero zero zero men to outflank the revolutionary position but was checked by generals benedict arnold and daniel morgan in the first battle of saratoga on september one nine one seven seven seven after the battle the two armies dug in burgoyne was in trouble now but he hoped that help from the south might be on the way all along burgoyne had suggested that his invasion from canada might be supported by a british offensive up the hudson river from howe s location in new york city however british war planners did not coordinate their efforts general howe had instead sailed away from new york on an expedition to capture philadelphia see next section british general henry clinton left in command at new york did indeed sail up the hudson in october capturing several forts and burning kingston then the rebel capital of new york but his efforts were not enough to affect the events at saratoga revolutionary militiamen many of them outraged by the reported murder of an american woman at the hands of burgoyne s indian allies flocked to gates s army swelling his force to one one zero zero zero by the beginning of october burgoyne his position becoming desperate launched a new offensive the second battle of saratoga on october seven the attack was repelled and general arnold though relieved of command by gates rushed to the battle and led a decisive counterattack badly beaten burgoyne surrendered on october one seven saratoga is often regarded as the turning point of the war revolutionary confidence and determination suffering from howe s successful occupation of philadelphia was renewed even more importantly the victory encouraged france to enter the war against great britain spain and the netherlands soon did the same for the british the war had now become much more complicated philadelphia campaign one seven seven seven to one seven seven eight having secured new york city in his one seven seven six campaign in one seven seven seven general howe concentrated on capturing philadelphia the seat of the revolutionary government he moved slowly landing one five zero zero zero troops in late august at the northern end of chesapeake bay about five five miles nine zero km southwest of philadelphia washington positioned his one one zero zero zero men between howe and philadelphia but was outflanked and driven back at the battle of brandywine on september one one one seven seven seven the continental congress once again abandoned the city british and revolutionary forces maneuvered around each other for the next several days clashing in minor encounters such as the so called paoli massacre on september two six howe finally outmaneuvered washington and marched into philadelphia unopposed after taking the city the british garrisoned about nine zero zero zero troops in germantown five miles eight km above philadelphia washington unsuccessfully attacked germantown in early october and then retreated to watch and wait meanwhile the british secured the delaware river by taking with difficulty forts mifflin and mercer in november general washington s problems at this time were not just with the british in the so called conway cabal some politicians and officers unhappy with washington s recent performance as commander in chief secretively discussed his removal washington offended by the behind the scenes maneuvering laid the whole matter openly before congress his supporters rallied behind him and the episode abated washington and his army encamped at valley forge in december one seven seven seven about two zero miles three two km from philadelphia where they would stay for the next six months over the winter two five zero zero men out of one zero zero zero zero died from disease and exposure however the army eventually emerged from valley forge in good order thanks in part to a training program supervised by baron von steuben meanwhile there was a shakeup in the british command with general clinton replacing howe as commander in chief french entry into the war had changed british war strategy and clinton was ordered by the government to abandon philadelphia and defend new york city now vulnerable to french naval power washington s army shadowed clinton on his withdrawal and forced a battle at monmouth on june two eight one seven seven eight the last major battle in the north washington s second in command general charles lee ordered a controversial retreat during the battle allowing clinton s army to escape by july clinton was in new york city and washington was again at white plains both armies were back where they had been two years earlier with the exception of scattered minor actions in the north like the battle of stony point the focus of the war now shifted elsewhere war in the west main article frontier warfare during the american revolution george rogers clark s one eight zero mile two nine zero km trek in the dead of winter led to the capture of general henry hamilton lieutenant governor of canada west of the appalachian mountains the american revolutionary war was an indian war the british and the continental congress both courted american indians as allies or urged them to remain neutral and many native american communities became divided over what path to take like the iroquois confederacy tribes such as the cherokees and the shawnees split into factions delawares under white eyes signed the first american indian treaty with the united states but other delawares joined the british the british supplied their indian allies from forts along the great lakes and tribesmen staged raids on revolutionary settlements in new york kentucky pennsylvania and elsewhere joint iroquois loyalist attacks in the wyoming valley and at cherry valley in one seven seven eight helped provoke the scorched earth sullivan expedition into western new york during the summer of one seven seven nine on the western front every man woman and child regardless of race was a potential casualty in the ohio country the virginia frontiersman george rogers clark attempted to neutralize british influence among the ohio tribes by capturing the outposts of kaskaskia and vincennes in the summer of one seven seven eight when general henry hamilton the british commander at detroit retook vincennes clark returned in a surprise march in february one seven seven nine and captured hamilton himself however a decisive victory in the west eluded the united states even as their fortunes had risen in the east the low point on the frontier came in one seven eight two with the gnadenhutten massacre when pennsylvania militiamen unable to track down enemy warriors executed nearly one zero zero christian delaware noncombatants mostly women and children later that year in the last major encounter of the war a party of kentuckians was soundly defeated by a superior force of british regulars and native americans war in the south during the first three years of the american revolutionary war the primary military encounters were in the north one notable exception was in june one seven seven six when general henry clinton sailed south to attack charleston south carolina this ended in humiliating defeat for the british and the patriots remained in control of the southern states for the next three years starting in one seven seven eight the british once again turned their attention to georgia south carolina north carolina and virginia where they hoped to regain control by recruiting thousands of loyalists on december two nine one seven seven eight an expeditionary corps of three five zero zero men from clinton s army in new york captured savannah georgia an attempt by french and revolutionary forces to retake savannah failed on october nine one seven seven nine in this assault count casimir pulaski the polish commander of american revolutionary cavalry was mortally wounded with savannah secured clinton could now launch a new assault on charleston south carolina where he had failed in one seven seven six carolinas one seven eight zero to one seven eight one the young and dashing banastre tarleton was perhaps the best cavalry commander in the war and the most hated man in the south this portrait was painted by sir joshua reynolds in one seven eight two clinton finally moved against charleston in one seven eight zero blockading the harbor in march and building up about one zero zero zero zero troops in the area inside the city general benjamin lincoln commanded about two six five zero continentals and two five zero zero militiamen when british colonel banastre tarleton cut off the city s supply lines in victories at monck s corner in april and lenud s ferry in early may charleston was surrounded on may one two one seven eight zero general lincoln surrendered his five zero zero zero men the largest surrender of u s troops until the american civil war with relatively few casualties clinton had seized the south s biggest city and seaport winning perhaps the greatest british victory of the war and paving the way for what seemed like certain conquest of the south the remnants of the southern continental army began to withdraw to north carolina but were pursued by colonel tarleton who defeated them at the battle of waxhaws on may two nine one seven eight zero among the americans a story spread that tarleton had massacred many americans after they had surrendered the truth of this charge is still debated bloody tarleton became a hated name and tarleton s quarter referring to his reputed lack of mercy or quarter soon became a rallying cry with these events organized american military activity in the south had collapsed the states however carried on their functions and the war was carried on by partisans such as francis marion general clinton turned over british operations in the south to lord cornwallis the continental congress dispatched general horatio gates to the rescue with a new army but gates promptly suffered one of the worst defeats in u s military history at the battle of camden on august one six one seven eight zero setting the stage for cornwallis to invade north carolina the tables were quickly turned on cornwallis however one wing of his army was utterly defeated at the battle of kings mountain on october seven one seven eight zero delaying his move into north carolina kings mountain was noteworthy because it was not a battle between british redcoats and colonial troops it was a battle between american loyalists and american patriots the british plan to raise large loyalist armies failed not enough loyalists enlisted and those who did were at risk once the british army moved on only in georgia did the crown manage to create a counter revolutionary civil government gates was replaced by george washington s most dependable subordinate general nathanael greene greene assigned about one zero zero zero men to general daniel morgan a superb tactician who crushed tarleton s troops at the battle of cowpens on january one seven one seven eight one greene proceeded to wear down his opponents in a series of battles guilford court house hobkirk s hill ninety six and eutaw springs each of them tactically a victory for the british but giving no strategic advantage to the victors greene summed up his approach in a motto that would become famous we fight get beat rise and fight again unable to capture or destroy greene s army cornwallis moved north to to virginia virginia one seven seven five to one seven eight one virginia had been under revolutionary control since loyalist forces including runaway slaves under governor dunmore had been defeated at the battle of great bridge on december nine one seven seven five after the defeat dunmore and his troops took refuge on british ships off of norfolk which dunmore bombarded and burned on january one one seven seven six he was driven from an island in chesapeake bay that summer never to return british forces raided virginia sporadically during the war in january one seven eight one the rebel capital of richmond was put to the torch by none other than benedict arnold now a turncoat who had sold his services to the other side and was now a british general in march one seven eight one general washington dispatched lafayette to defend virginia the young frenchman had three two zero zero men at his command but british troops in the state now reinforced and commanded by cornwallis totaled seven two zero zero lafayette skirmished with cornwallis avoiding a decisive battle while gathering reinforcements the boy cannot escape me cornwallis is supposed to have said however cornwallis was unable to trap lafayette and so he moved his forces to yorktown virginia in july in order to link up with the british navy war at sea main article naval operations in the american revolutionary war meanwhile the co operation of the french became active in july count rochambeau arrived at newport rhode island that place had been occupied by the british from one seven seven six to the close of one seven seven nine an unsuccessful attempt was made to drive them out in one seven seven eight by the revolutionaries assisted by the french admiral d estaing and a french corps first battle of ushant july two seven one seven seven eight john paul jones continental navy battle of cape st vincent one seven eight zero second battle of ushant december one two one seven eight one gulf coast after spain declared war against great britain in june of one seven seven nine count bernardo de g lvez the spanish governor of louisiana seized three british mississippi river outposts manchac baton rouge and natchez g lvez then captured mobile on march one four one seven eight zero and in may of one seven eight one forced the surrender of the british outpost at pensacola florida on may eight one seven eight two g lvez captured the british naval base at new providence in the bahamas galvez also supplied soldiers to george rogers clark and had been supplying substantial quantities of war supplies to the american rebels from as early as one seven seven seven caribbean the battle of the saintes took place in one seven eight two during the american war of independence and was a victory of a british fleet under admiral sir george rodney over a french fleet under the comte de grasse the defeat dashed the hopes of france and spain to take jamaica and other colonies from the british india the franco british war spilled over into india in one seven eight zero in the form of the second anglo mysore war the two chief combatants were tipu sultan ruler of the kingdom of mysore and a key french ally and the british government of madras the anglo mysore conflict was bloody but inconclusive and ended in a draw at the treaty of mangalore in one seven eight four netherlands also in one seven eight zero the british struck against the united provinces of the netherlands in the fourth anglo dutch war to preempt dutch involvement in the league of armed neutrality directed primarily against the british navy during the war agitation by dutch radicals and a friendly attitude towards the united states by the dutch government both influenced by the american revolution also encouraged the british to attack the war lasted into one seven eight four and was disastrous to the dutch mercantile economy mediterranean on february five one seven eight two spanish and french forces captured minorca which had been under british control since the treaty of utrecht in one seven one three a further franco spanish effort to recover gibraltar was unsuccessful minorca was ceded to spain in the peace treaty whitehaven an interesting footnote to this war was the actual landing on britain itself of a ship from the u s navy this occurred in one seven seven eight when the port of whitehaven in cumberland was raided by john paul jones the landing was a surprise attack taken as an action of revenge by jones and was never intended as an invasion nevertheless it caused hysteria in england with the attack showing a weakness that could be exploited by other states such as france or spain its result was an intense period of fortification in british ports war s end the northern southern and naval theaters of the war converged at yorktown in one seven eight one on september five one seven eight one french naval forces defeated the british royal navy at the battle of the chesapeake cutting off cornwallis s supplies and transport washington hurriedly moved his troops from new york and a combined franco american force of one seven zero zero zero troops commenced the battle of yorktown on

protracted struggle covering the immense territory in america consequent failure of the british to use their more efficient military strength effectively the safe and fabian generalship of washington and perhaps most significantly the french alliance and european combinations by which at the close of the conflict left great britain without a friend or ally on the continent decisive victory eluded

one coulomb per second it is named after andr marie amp re one of the main discoverers of electromagnetism definition the ampere is that constant current which if maintained in two straight parallel conductors of infinite length of negligible circular cross section and placed one metre apart in vacuum would produce between these conductors a force equal to two newton per metre of length explanation because it is a base unit the definition of the ampere is not tied to any other electrical unit the definition for the ampere is equivalent to fixing a value of the permeability of vacuum to zero four h m prior to one nine four eight the so called international ampere was used defined in terms of the electrolytic deposition rate of silver the older unit is equal to zero nine nine nine eight five a the ampere is most accurately realised using an ampere balance but is in practice maintained via ohm s law from the units of voltage and resistance the volt and the ohm since the latter two can be tied to physical phenomena that are relatively easy to reproduce the josephson junction and the quantum hall effect respectively the unit of electric charge the coulomb is defined in terms of the ampere one coulomb is the amount of electric charge formerly quantity of electricity carried in a current of one ampere flowing for one second current electricity then is the rate at which charge flows through a wire or surface one ampere of current i is equal to a flow of one coulomb of charge q per second of time t mathrm since a coulomb is approximately equal to six two four elementary charges one ampere is equivalent to six two four elementary charges such as electrons moving through a surface in one second more precisely using the si definitions for the conventional values of the josephson and von klitzing constants the ampere can be defined as exactly six two four one five zero nine six two nine one five two six five elementary charges per second see also si ohm

a position behind the offensive line or behind the linebackers on defense blitz a defensive maneuver in which one or more linebackers or defensive backs who normally remain behind the line of scrimmage instead charge into the opponents backfield however in the three four defense one linebacker typically rushes the passer with the three down linemen this is not considered a blitz if an additional linebacker is sent bringing the total number of rushers to five it is a blitz blocking when a player obstructs another player s path with his body bootleg an offensive play predicated upon misdirection in which the quarterback pretends to hand the ball to another player and then carries the ball in the opposite direction of the supposed ballcarrier with the intent of either passing or running sometimes the quarterback has the option of doing either a naked bootleg is a risky variation of this play when the quarterback has no blockers pulling out with him contrast with scramble

he is close enough will often attempt to kick the ball out of bounds close to the receiving team s goal line and pin them back near their own end zone contain a defensive assignment on outside runs such as the sweep one defensive player usually a cornerback or outside linebacker is assigned to keep the rusher from getting to the edge of the play and turning upfield if executed properly the rusher will have to turn upfield before the play calls for it giving the linebackers a better chance of stopping the play for little or no gain cornerback cb a defensive back who lines up near the line of scrimmage across from a wide receiver their primary job is to disrupt passing routes and to defend against short and medium passes in the passing game and to contain the rusher on rushing plays counter a running play in which the running back will take a step in the apparent direction of the play ie the direction the line is moving only to get the handoff in the other direction weak side linemen will sometimes pull and lead the back downfield sometimes called a counter trap but not necessarily the play is designed to get the defense to flow away from the action for a few steps as they follow the linemen allowing more room for the running back crackback block an illegal block delivered below the opponent s waist by an offensive player who had left the area of close line play and then returned to it or was not within it at the snap the term is also used to describe a legal block delivered from the front or from the side with the offensive player s helmet in front of the

technique in which offensive linemen and sometimes other blockers block legally below the waist i e from the front of the defensive player in an attempt to bring the defenders to ground making them

because a dime has the same value as two nickels double reverse a play in which the ball reverses direction twice behind the line of scrimmage this is usually accomplished by means of two or three hand offs each hand off going in an opposite direction as the previous one such a play is extremely infrequent in football some people confuse the double reverse with a reverse which is a play with two hand offs instead of three down one of a series of plays in which the offensive team must advance at least one zero yards or lose possession first down is the first of the plays fourth is the last down in american and third in canadian football a first down occurs after a change of possession of the ball after advancing the ball one zero yards following a previous first down or after certain

incomplete pass it stops the clock note that a spike is not considered intentional grounding splits the distance between the feet of adjacent offensive linemen said to be wide if there is a large gap between players or narrow if the gap is small split end a player position on offence a receiver who lines up on the line of scrimmage several yards outside the offensive linemen the term is no longer used in american football having been long since replaced by the wide receiver or wideout with no distinction between whether the receiver is on the line or not squib kick a type of kickoff in which the ball is intentionally kicked low to the ground typically bouncing on the ground a few times before being picked up this is done in the hopes of preventing a long return as the ball is often picked up by one of the upmen as opposed to the designated kickoff returner sticks the pole attached to the end of the one zero yard chain that is used by the chain crew to measure for a new series of downs i e the line to gain a new first down stiff arm or straight arm a ballcarrier warding off a would be tackler by pushing them away with a straight arm strong i a formation wherein the tailback is lined up deep directly behind the quarterback and the fullback is lined up offset to the strong side of the formation strong safety ss a kind of safety on defense as opposed to a free safety this is a central defensive back originally the term indicated that he lined up on the strong side of the field and covered the tight end however the modern usage of the term now indicates a central defensive back with responsibility for run and pass support slightly favoring run support strong side simplistically speaking the side of the field left or right that has the most players but it depends on the formations of the teams when a team uses one tight end the strong side is the side of the field where the tight end lines up if the offensive package uses no tight end or more than one tight end the strong side is the side of the field with the most offensive players on or just behind the line of scrimmage stunt a tactic used by defensive linemen in which they switch roles in an attempt to get past the blockers both defenders will start with power rushes with the stunting defender getting more of a push the other lineman will then go around him ideally using him as a pick to get free from his blocker sweep a running play in which several blockers lead a running back on a designed play to the outside depending on the number of blockers and the design of the play this is sometimes referred to as a power sweep or student body right or left t t formation a classic offensive formation with the quarterback directly behind the center and three running backs behind the quarterback forming a t numerous variations have been developed including the split t wing t and wishbone t tackle the act of forcing a ball carrier to the ground a player position on the line either an offensive tackle or a defensive tackle see linemen tackle box the area between where the two offensive tackles line up prior to the snap tailback player position on offense farthest deepest back except in kicking formations also often referred to as the running back particularly in a one back offense three and out when an offensive team fails to gain a first down on the first three plays of a drive and thus is forced to punt on fourth down three point stance a down lineman s stance with three points on the ground in another words his two feet and one of his hands tight end a player position on offense an eligible receiver ligned up on the line of scrimmage next to the offensive tackle tight ends are used as blockers during running plays and either run a route or stay in to block during passing plays touchback the act of downing the ball behind one s own goal line after the ball had been propelled over the goal by the opposing team after a touchback the team that downed it gets the ball at their own two zero yard line touchdown a play worth six points accomplished by gaining legal possession of the ball in the opponent s end zone it also allows the team a chance for one extra point by kicking the ball or a two point conversion see try below trap a basic blocking pattern in which a defensive lineman is allowed past the line of scrimmage only to be blocked at an angle by a pulling lineman designed to gain a preferred blocking angle and larger hole in the line trips a formation in which three wide receivers are lined up close to one another on the same side of the field also refers to those receivers used to create potential for confusion or collision between defenders as these receivers split up two point conversion a play worth two points accomplished by gaining legal possession of the ball in the opponent s end zone after a touchdown has been made see try below try a scrimmage play from close to their opponent s goal line awarded to a team which has scored a touchdown allowing them and in some codes their opponents to score an additional one or two points also called try for point conversion convert canadian extra point s point s after touchdown or pat u unbalanced line usually refers to an offensive formation which does not have an equal number of linemen on each side of the ball done to gain a blocking advantage on one side of the formation typically one tackle or guard lines up on the other side of the ball for example a common alignment would be e g c g t t e upman during a kickoff every player on the return team is called an upman with the exception of the one or two designated kickoff returners who stand furthest away from the starting point of the kicking team v veer a type of option offense using two backs in the backfield one behind each guard or tackle referred to as split backs allowing a triple option play give to either back or quarterback keep w weak i a formation wherein the tailback is lined up deep directly behind the quarterback and the fullback is lined up offset to the weak side of the formation weak side when one tight end is used the side of the field opposite the tight end in other offensive packages the side of the field with the fewest offensive players on or just behind the line of scrimmage west coast offense an offensive philosophy that uses short high percentage passes as the core of a ball control offense widely used but originally made popular by san francisco four nine ers coach bill walsh a main component of the west coast offense is use of all the eligible receivers in the short passing game wide receiver a player position on offense he is split wide usually about one zero yards from the formation and plays on the line of scrimmage as a split end or one yard off as a flanker will the w eak side linebacker wing back a player position in some offensive formations lines up just outside the tight end and one yard off the line of scrimmage may be a receiver but is more typically used as a blocking back wishbone a formation involving three running backs lined up behind the quarterback in the shape of a y similar to the shape of a wishbone x x receiver term used in play calling that usually refers to the split end or the wide receiver that lines up on the line of scrimmage for example split right jet five two nine x post tells the x receiver to run a post route y y receiver term usually used in offensive play calling to refer to the tight end for example buffalo right five three four boot y corner tells the y receiver to run a corner route z z receiver a term used in offensive play calling that usually refers to the flanker or the wide receiver that lines up off the line of scrimmage for example panther gun eight five slant z go tells the z receiver to run a go also called a fly or streak route zone defense a defense in which players who are in pass coverage cover zones of the field instead of individual players pure zone packages are seldom used most defenses employ some combination of zone and man coverage zone blitz a defensive package combining a blitz with zone pass coveragee allows the defense to choose the blitzer after the offense shows formation and pass coverage requirements and features unpredictable blitzes from different linebackers and defensive backs invented by coach dick lebeau american football terminology glossaries flowcharts are often used to represent algorithms in mathematics and computer science an algorithm is a procedure a finite set of well defined instructions for accomplishing some task which given an initial state will terminate in a defined end state informally the concept of an algorithm is often illustrated by the example of a recipe although many algorithms are much more complex algorithms often have steps that repeat iterate or require decisions such as logic or comparison the concept of an algorithm originated as a means of recording procedures for solving mathematical problems such as finding the common divisor of two numbers or multiplying two numbers the concept was formalized in one nine three six through alan turing s turing machines and alonzo church s lambda calculus which in turn formed the foundation of computer science most algorithms can be implemented by computer programs history the word algorithm comes from the name of the nine th century mathematician abu abdullah muhammad bin musa al khwarizmi the word algorism originally referred only to the rules of performing arithmetic using hindu arabic numerals but evolved via european latin translation of al khwarizmi s name into algorithm by the one eight th century the word evolved to include all definite procedures for solving problems or performing tasks the first case of an algorithm written for a computer was ada byron s notes on the analytical engine written in one eight four two for which she is considered by many to be the world s first programmer however since charles babbage never completed his analytical engine the algorithm was never implemented on it the lack of mathematical rigor in the well defined procedure definition of algorithms posed some difficulties for mathematicians and logicians of the one nine th and early two zero th centuries this problem was largely solved with the description of the turing machine an abstract model of a computer formulated by alan turing and the demonstration that every method yet found for describing well defined procedures advanced by other mathematicians could be emulated on a turing machine a statement known as the church turing thesis nowadays a formal criterion for an algorithm is that it is a procedure that can be implemented on a completely specified turing machine or one of the equivalent formalisms formalization of algorithms algorithms are essential to the way computers process information because a computer program is essentially an algorithm that tells the computer what specific steps to perform in what specific order in order to carry out a specified task such as calculating employees paychecks or printing students report cards thus an algorithm can be considered to be any sequence of operations which can be performed by a turing complete system typically when an algorithm is associated with processing information data is read from an input source or device written to an output sink or device and or stored for further use stored data is regarded as part of the internal state of the entity performing the algorithm the state is stored in a data structure for any such computational process the algorithm must be rigorously defined specified in the way it applies in all possible circumstances that could arise that is any conditional steps must be systematically dealt with case by case the criteria for each case must be clear and computable because an algorithm is a precise list of precise steps the order of computation will almost always be critical to the functioning of the algorithm instructions are usually assumed to be listed explicitly and are described as starting from the top and going down to the bottom an idea that is described more formally by flow of control so far this discussion of the formalization of an algorithm has assumed the premises of imperative programming this is the most common conception and it attempts to describe a task in discrete mechanical means unique to this conception of formalized algorithms is the assignment operation setting the value of a variable it derives from the intuition of memory as a scratchpad there is an example below of such an assignment see functional programming and logic programming for alternate conceptions of what constitutes an algorithm some writers restrict the definition of algorithm to procedures that eventually finish others include procedures that could run forever without stopping arguing that some entity may be required to carry out such permanent tasks in the latter case success can no longer be defined in terms of halting with a meaningful output instead terms of success that allow for unbounded output sequences must be defined for example an algorithm that verifies if there are more zeros than ones in an infinite random binary sequence must run forever to be effective if it is implemented correctly however the algorithm s output will be useful for as long as it examines the sequence the algorithm will give a positive response while the number of examined zeros outnumber the ones and a negative response otherwise success for this algorithm could then be defined as eventually outputting only positive responses if there are actually more zeros than ones in the sequence and in any other case outputting any mixture of positive and negative responses summarizing the above discussion about what algorithm should consist zero or more inputs one or more outputs finiteness or computability definitiveness or preciseness implementation an algorithm is a set of steps to perform a computation most algorithms will be implemented as computer programs they can be expressed in any notation including english for documenting and research purposes a more preferred way is to embody or sometimes called codify an algorithm by writing of its pseudocode pseudocode representation avoids ambiguities that are common in english statements the pseudocode can also be translated into particular programming language more straightforwardly algorithms are implemented not only as computer programs but often also by other means such as in a biological neural network for example the human brain implementing arithmetic or an insect relocating food in electric circuits or in a mechanical device example one of the simplest algorithms is to find the largest number in an unsorted list of numbers the solution necessarily requires looking at every number in the list but only once at each from this follows a simple algorithm which can be stated in english as let us assume the first item is largest look at each of the remaining items in the list and make the following adjustment a if it is larger than the largest item we gathered so far make a note of it the latest noted item is the largest in the list when the process is complete and here is a more formal coding of the algorithm in pseudocode input a non empty list of numbers l output the largest number in the list l largest l zero for each item in the list l one do if the item largest then largest the item return largest for a more complex example see euclid s algorithm which is one of the oldest algorithms algorithm analysis as it happens most people who implement algorithms want to know how much of a particular resource such as time or storage is required for a given algorithm methods have been developed for the analysis of algorithms to obtain such quantitative answers for example the algorithm above has a time requirement of o n using the big o notation with n as the length of the list at all times the algorithm only needs to remember two values the largest number found so far and its current position in the input list therefore it is said to have a space requirement of o one note that the size of the inputs is not counted as space used by the algorithm different algorithms may complete the same task with a different set of instructions in less or more time space or effort than others for example given two different recipes for making potato salad one may have peel the potato before boil the potato while the other presents the steps in the reverse order yet they both call for these steps to be repeated for all potatoes and end when the potato salad is ready to be eaten the analysis and study of algorithms is one discipline of computer science and is often practiced abstractly without the use of a specific programming language or other implementation in this sense it resembles other mathematical disciplines in that the analysis focuses on the underlying principles of the algorithm and not on any particular implementation the pseudocode is simplest and abstract enough for such analysis classes there are various ways to classify algorithms each with its own merits classification by implementation one way to classify algorithms is by implementation means recursion or iteration a recursive algorithm is one that invokes makes reference to itself repeatedly until a certain condition matches which is a method common to functional programming iterative algorithms use repetitive constructs like loops and sometimes additional data structures like stacks to solve the given problems some problems are naturally suited for one implementation to other for example towers of hanoi is well understood in recursive implementation every recursive version has an equivalent but possibly more or less complex iterative version and vice versa serial or parallel algorithms are usually discussed with the assumption that computers execute one instruction of an algorithm at a time those computers are sometimes called serial computers an algorithm designed for such an environment is called a serial algorithm as opposed to parallel algorithms which take advantage of computer architectures where several processors can work on a problem at the same time parallel algorithms divide the problem into more symmetrical or asymmetrical subproblems and pass them to many processors and put the results back together at one end the resource consumption in parallel algorithms is both processor cycles on each processors and also the communication overhead between the processors sorting algorithms can be parallelized efficiently but their communication overhead is expensive recursive algorithms are generally parallelizable some problems have no parallel algorithms and are called inherently serial problems those problems cannot be solved faster by employing more processors iterative numerical methods such as newton s method or the three body problem are algorithms which are inherently serial deterministic or random deterministic algorithms solve the problem with exact decision at every step of the algorithm random algorithms as their name suggests explore the search space randomly until an acceptable solution is found various heuristic algorithms see below generally fall into the random category exact or approximate while many algorithms reach an exact solution approximation algorithms seek an approximation which is close to the true solution approximation may use either a deterministic or a random strategy such algorithms have practical value for many hard problems classification by design paradigm another way of classifying algorithms is by their design methodology or paradigm there is a certain number of paradigms each different from the other furthermore each of these categories will include many different types of algorithms some commonly found paradigms include divide and conquer a divide and conquer algorithm repeatedly reduces an instance of a problem to one or more smaller instances of the same problem usually recursively until the instances are small enough to solve easily one such example of divide and conquer is merge sorting sorting can be done on each segment of data after dividing data into segments and sorting of entire data can be obtained in conquer phase by merging them a simpler variant of divide and conquer is called decrease and conquer algorithm that solves an identical subproblem and uses the solution of this subproblem to solve the bigger problem divide and conquer divides the problem into multiple subproblems and so conquer stage will be more complex than decrease and conquer algorithms an example of decrease and conquer algorithm is binary search algorithm dynamic programming when a problem shows optimal substructure meaning the optimal solution to a problem can be constructed from optimal solutions to subproblems and overlapping subproblems meaning the same subproblems are used to solve many different problem instances we can often solve the problem quickly using dynamic programming an approach that avoids recomputing solutions that have already been computed for example the shortest path to a goal from a vertex in a weighted graph can be found by using the shortest path to the goal from all adjacent vertices dynamic programming and memoization go together the main difference between dynamic programming and divide and conquer is subproblems are more or less independent in divide and conquer where as the overlap of subproblems occur in dynamic programming the difference between the dynamic programming and straightforward recursion is in caching or memoization of recursive calls where subproblems are independent there is no chance of repetition and memoization does not help so dynamic programming is not a solution for all by using memoization or maintaining a table of subproblems already solved dynamic programming reduces the exponential nature of many problems to polynomial complexity the greedy method a greedy algorithm is similar to a dynamic programming algorithm but the difference is that solutions to the subproblems do not have to be known at each stage instead a greedy choice can be made of what looks best for the moment difference between dynamic programming and greedy method is it extends the solution with the best possible decision not all feasible decisions at a algorithmic stage based on the current local optimum and the best decision not all possible decisions made in previous stage it is not exhaustive and does not give accurate answer to many problems but when it works it will be the fastest method the most popular greedy algorithm is finding the minimal spanning tree as given by kruskal linear programming when solving a problem using linear programming the program is put into a number of linear inequalities and then an attempt is made to maximize or minimize the inputs many problems such as the maximum flow for directed graphs can be stated in a linear programming way and then be solved by a generic algorithm such as the simplex algorithm a complex variant of linear programming is called integer programming where the solution space is restricted to all integers reduction it is another powerful technique in solving many problems by transforming one problem into another problem for example one selection algorithm for finding the median in an unsorted list is first translating this problem into sorting problem and finding the middle element in sorted list the goal of reduction algorithms is finding the simplest transformation such that complexity of reduction algorithm does not dominate the complexity of reduced algorithm this technique is also called transform and conquer search and enumeration many problems such as playing chess can be modeled as problems on graphs a graph exploration algorithm specifies rules for moving around a graph and is useful for such problems this category also includes the search algorithms and backtracking the probabilistic and heuristic paradigm algorithms belonging to this class fit the definition of an algorithm more loosely probabilistic algorithms are those that make some choices randomly or pseudo randomly for some problems it can in fact be proven that the fastest solutions must involve some randomness genetic algorithms attempt to find solutions to problems by mimicking biological evolutionary processes with a cycle of random mutations yielding successive generations of solutions thus they emulate reproduction and survival of the fittest in genetic programming this approach is extended to algorithms by regarding the algorithm itself as a solution to a problem also there are heuristic algorithms whose general purpose is not to find an optimal solution but an approximate solution where the time or resources to find a perfect solution are not practical an example of this would be local search taboo search or simulated annealing algorithms a class of heuristic probabilistic algorithms that vary the solution of a problem by a random amount the name simulated annealing alludes to the metallurgic term meaning the heating and cooling of metal to achieve freedom from defects the purpose of the random variance is to find close to globally optimal solutions rather than simply locally optimal ones the idea being that the random element will be decreased as the algorithm settles down to a solution classification by field of study every field of science has its own problems and needs efficient algorithms related problems in one field are often studied together some example classes are search algorithms sort algorithms merge algorithms numerical algorithms graph algorithms string algorithms computational geometric algorithms combinatorial algorithms machine learning cryptography data compression algorithms and parsing techniques see also list of algorithms for more details some of these fields overlap with each other and advancing in algorithms for one field causes advancement in many fields and sometimes completely unrelated fields for example dynamic programming is originally invented for optimisation in resource consumption in industries but it is used in solving broad range of problems in many fields classification by complexity some algorithms complete in linear time and some complete in exponential amount of time and some never complete one problem may have multiple algorithms and some problems may have no algorithms some problems have no known efficient algorithms there are also mappings from some problems to other problems so computer scientists found it is suitable to classify the problems rather than algorithms into equivalence classes based on the complexity see also complexity classes for more details legal issues some countries allow algorithms to be patented when embodied in software or in hardware patents have long been a controversial issue see for example the software patent debate some countries do not allow certain algorithms such as cryptographic algorithms to be exported from that country see also algorism

annuals are often used in gardens to provide splashes of color as they tend to produce more flowers than perennials some perennials and biennials are grown in gardens as annuals for convenience particularly if they are not considered hardy for the local climate also many food plants are or are grown as annuals including most domesticated grains the life cycle of an annual can occur in a period as short as two or three months in some species though most last a bit longer vegetables grown in apartment container gardens can last up to two years if they are maintained indoors during the winter months examples of annual plants include peas cauliflowers basil and marigolds see also biennial plant perennial plant botany gardening anthophyta is a descriptive botanical name that may be

agreed that the use of mouthwash does not eliminate the need for both brushing and flossing common use involves rinsing one s mouth with about two zero ml two three oz of mouthwash two times a day after brushing the mouthwash is typically swished or gargled for about half a minute and then spit out active ingredients in commercial brands of mouthwash can include thymol eucalyptol methyl salicylate menthol chlorhexidine gluconate hydrogen peroxide and sometimes enzymes and calcium ingredients also include water sweeteners such as sorbitol and sodium saccharine and a significant amount

from pompeii from a three rd century bc original greek painting now lost alexander the great in greek transliterated megas alexandros alexander iii of macedon was born in pella macedon in july three five six bc died in babylon on june one zero three two three bc king of macedon three three six three two three bc is considered one of the most successful military commanders in world history if not the greatest conquering most of the known world before his death alexander is also known in the zoroastrian middle persian work arda wiraz n mag as the accursed alexander due to his conquest of the persian empire and the destruction of its capital persepolis he is also known in middle eastern traditions as dhul qarnayn in arabic and dul qarnayim in hebrew and aramaic the two horned one apparently due to an image on coins minted during his rule that seemingly depicted him with the two ram s horns of the egyptian god ammon he is known as sikandar in hindi in fact in india the term sikandar is used as a synonym for expert or extremely skilled following the unification of the multiple city states of ancient greece under the rule of his father philip ii of macedon a labor alexander had to repeat twice because the southern greeks rebelled after philip s death alexander conquered the persian empire including anatolia syria phoenicia gaza egypt bactria and mesopotamia and extended the boundaries of his own empire as far as the punjab alexander integrated foreigners non macedonians non greeks into his army and administration leading some scholars to credit him with a policy of fusion he encouraged marriage between his army and foreigners and practiced it himself after twelve years of constant military campaigning alexander died possibly of malaria typhoid viral encephalitis or even a drug overdose his conquests ushered in centuries of greek settlement and rule over foreign areas a period known as the hellenistic age alexander himself lived on in the history and myth of both greek and non greek cultures already during his lifetime and especially after his death his exploits inspired a literary tradition in which he appears as a towering legendary hero in the tradition of achilles early life bust of alexander iii in the british museum alexander was the son of king philip ii of macedon and of epirote princess olympias according to plutarch alexander three one three olympias was impregnated not by philip who was afraid of her and her affinity for sleeping in the company of snakes but by zeus plutarch alexander two two three relates that both philip and olympias dreamt of their son s future birth olympias dreamed of a loud burst of thunder and of lightning striking her womb in philip s dream he sealed her womb with the seal of the lion alarmed by this he consulted the seer aristander of telmessus who determined that his wife was pregnant and that the child would have the character of a lion aristotle was alexander s tutor he gave alexander a thorough training in rhetoric and literature and stimulated his interest in science medicine and philosophy after his visit to the oracle of ammon at siwa according to all five of the extant historians arrian curtius diodorus justin and plutarch rumors spread that the oracle had revealed alexander s father to be zeus rather than philip according to plutarch alexander two one his father descended from heracles through caranus and his mother descended from aeacus through neoptolemus and achilles aristotle gave him a copy of the illiad and a knife that he always hid under his pillow at night the ascent of macedon when philip led an attack on byzantium in three four zero bc alexander aged one six was left in command of macedonia in three three nine bc philip took a second wife to the chagrin of alexander s mother olympias which led to a quarrel between alexander and his father and threw into question alexander s succession to the macedonian throne in three three eight bc philip created the league of corinth alexander also assisted his father at the decisive battle of chaeronea in this year the cavalry wing led by alexander annihilated the sacred band of thebes an elite corps previously regarded as invincible philip was content to deprive thebes of her dominion over boeotia and leave a macedonian garrison in the citadel in three three six bc philip was assassinated at the wedding of his daughter cleopatra to king alexander of epirus the assassin was supposedly a former lover of the king the disgruntled young nobleman pausanias who held a grudge against philip because the king had ignored a complaint he had expressed philip s murder was once thought to have been planned with the knowledge and involvement of alexander or olympias another possible instigator could have been darius iii the recently crowned king of persia plutarch mentions an irate letter from alexander to darius where alexander blames darius and bagoas his grand vizier for his father s murder stating that it was darius who had been bragging with the greek cities of how he managed to assassinate philip after philip s death the army proclaimed alexander then aged two zero as the new king of macedon greek cities like athens and thebes which had been forced to pledge allegiance to philip saw in the new king an opportunity to retake their full independence alexander moved swiftly and thebes which had been most active against him submitted when he appeared at its gates the assembled greeks at the isthmus of corinth with the sole exception of the spartans elected him to the command against persia which had previously been bestowed upon his father the next year three three five bc alexander felt free to engage the thracians and the illyrians in order to secure the danube as the northern boundary of the macedonian kingdom while he was triumphantly campaigning north the thebans and athenians rebelled once again alexander reacted immediately and while the other cities once again hesitated thebes decided this time to resist with the utmost vigor the resistance was useless in the end the city was conquered with great bloodshed the thebans encountered an ever harsher fate when their city was razed to the ground and its territory divided between the other boeotian cities moreover all of the city s citizens were sold into slavery sparing only the priests the leaders of the pro macedonian party and the descendants of pindar whose house was the only one left untouched the end of thebes cowed athens into submission and it readily accepted alexander s demand for the exile of all the leaders of the anti macedonian party demosthenes first of all period of conquests map of alexander s empire the fall of the persian empire alexander s army had crossed the hellespont with about four two zero zero zero soldiers primarily macedonians and greeks but also including some thracians paionians and illyrians after an initial victory against persian forces at the battle of granicus alexander accepted the surrender of the persian provincial capital and treasury of sardis and proceeded down the ionian coast at halicarnassus alexander successfully waged the first of many sieges eventually forcing his opponents the mercenary captain memnon of rhodes and the persian satrap of caria orontobates to withdraw by sea alexander left caria in the hands of ada who was ruler of caria before being deposed by her brother pixodarus from halicarnassus alexander proceeded into mountainous lycia and the pamphylian plain asserting control over all coastal cities and denying them to his enemy from pamphylia onward the coast held no major ports and so alexander moved inland at termessus alexander humbled but did not storm the pisidian city at the ancient phrygian capital of gordium alexander undid the tangled gordian knot a feat said to await the future king of asia according to the most vivid story alexander proclaimed that it did not matter how the knot was undone and he hacked it apart with his sword another version claims that he did not use the sword but actually figured out how to undo the knot alexander battling darius at the battle of issus pompei mosaic alexander s army crossed the cilician gates met and defeated the main persian army under the command of darius iii at the battle of issus in three three three bc darius fled this battle in such a panic for his life that he left behind his wife his children his mother and much of his personal treasure sisygambis the queen mother never forgave darius for abandoning her she disowned him and adopted alexander as her son instead proceeding down the mediterranean coast he took tyre and gaza after famous sieges see siege of tyre alexander passed near but probably did not visit jerusalem in three three two bc three three one bc alexander was welcomed as a liberator in egypt and was pronounced the son of zeus by egyptian priests of the god ammon at the oracle of the god at the siwa oasis in the libyan desert he founded alexandria in egypt which would become the prosperous capital of the ptolemaic dynasty after his death leaving egypt alexander marched eastward into assyria now northern iraq and defeated darius and a third persian army at the battle of gaugamela darius was forced to flee the field after his charioteer was killed and alexander chased him as far as arbela while darius fled over the mountains to ecbatana modern hamadan alexander marched to babylon statuette of a greek soldier from a four th three rd century bc burial site north of the tian shan

bulk of his army to persepolis the persian capital by the royal road alexander stormed and captured the persian gates in the modern zagros mountains then sprinted for persepolis before its treasury could be looted alexander allowed the league forces to loot persepolis a fire broke out in the eastern palace of xerxes and spread to the rest of the city it was not known if it was a drunken accident or a deliberate act of revenge for the burning of the athenian acropolis during the second persian war the book of arda wiraz a zoroastrian work composed in the three rd or four th century ad also

certain measure of skepticism because it is generally thought that for many centuries the avesta was transmitted mainly orally by the magians he then set off in pursuit of darius who was kidnapped and then murdered by followers of bessus his bactrian satrap and kinsman bessus then declared himself darius successor as artaxerxes v and retreated into central asia to launch a guerrilla campaign against alexander with the death of darius alexander declared the war of vengeance over and released his greek and other allies from service in the league campaign although he allowed those that wished to re enlist as mercenaries in his imperial army his three year campaign against first bessus and then the satrap of sogdiana spitamenes took him through media parthia aria drangiana arachosia bactria and scythia in the process he captured and refounded herat and maracanda moreover he founded a series of new cities all called alexandria including modern kandahar in afghanistan and alexandria eschate the furthest in modern tajikistan in the end both were betrayed by their men bessus in three two nine bc and spitamenes the year after hostility toward alexander during this time alexander adopted some elements of persian dress and customs at his court notably the custom of proskynesis a symbolic kissing of the hand that persians paid to their social superiors but a practice of which the greeks disapproved the greeks regarded the gesture as the preserve of deities and believed that alexander meant to deify himself by requiring it this cost him much in the sympathies of many of his countrymen here too a plot against his life was revealed and his companion philotas was executed for treason for failing to bring the plot to his attention parmenion philotas father who was at the head of an army at ecbatana was assassinated by command of alexander who feared that parmenion might attempt to avenge his son several other trials for treason followed and many macedonians were executed later on in a drunken quarrel at maracanda he also killed the man who had saved his life at granicus clitus the black later in the central asian campaign a second plot against his life this one by his own pages was revealed and his official historian callisthenes of olynthus who had fallen out of favor with the king by leading the opposition to his attempt to introduce proskynesis was implicated on what many historians regard as trumped up charges however the evidence is strong that callisthenes the teacher of the pages must have been the one who persuaded them to assassinate the king the invasion of india coin commemorating alexander s campaigns in india struck in babylon around three two three bc obv alexander standing being crowned by nike fully armed and holding zeus thunderbolt rev greek rider possibly alexander attacking an indian battle elephant possibly fleeing porus with the death of spitamenes and his marriage to roxana roshanak in bactrian to cement his relations with his new central asian satrapies in three two six bc alexander was finally free to turn his attention to india king ambhi ruler of taxila surrendered the city to alexander many people had fled to a high fortress called aornos alexander took aornos by storm alexander fought an epic battle against porus a ruler of a region in the punjab in the battle of hydaspes in three two six bc after attaining victory alexander made an alliance with porus and appointed him as satrap of his own kingdom alexander then named one of the two new cities that he founded bucephala in honor of his noble mount who had brought him to india alexander continued on to conquer all the headwaters of the indus river east of porus kingdom near the ganges river was the powerful empire of magadha ruled by the nanda dynasty fearing the prospects of facing another powerful indian army and exhausted by years of campaigning his army mutinied at the hyphasis modern beas refusing to march further east alexander after the meeting with his officer coenus was convinced that it was better to return alexander was forced to turn south conquering his way down the indus to the indian ocean he sent much of his army to carmania modern southern iran with his general craterus and commissioned a fleet to explore the persian gulf shore under his admiral nearchus while he led the rest of his forces back to persia by the southern route through the gedrosia present day makran in southern pakistan after india alexander and porus by charles le brun one six seven three discovering that many of his satraps and military governors had misbehaved in his absence alexander executed a number of them as examples on his way to susa as a gesture of thanks he paid off the debts of his soldiers and announced that he would send those over aged and disabled veterans back to macedonia under craterus but his troops misunderstood his intention and mutinied at the town of opis refusing to be sent away and bitterly criticizing his adoption of persian customs and dress and the introduction of persian officers and soldiers into macedonian units alexander executed the ringleaders of the mutiny but forgave the rank and file in an attempt to craft a lasting harmony between his macedonian and persian subjects he held a mass marriage of his senior officers to persian and other noblewomen at opis but few of those marriages seem to have lasted much beyond a year his attempts to merge persian culture with his greek soldiers also included training a regiment of persian boys in the ways of macedonians it is not certain that alexander adopted the persian royal title of shahanshah great king or king of kings however most historians believe that he did alexander let it be known that he intended to launch a campaign against the tribes of arabia after they were subjugated it was assumed that alexander would turn westwards and attack carthage and italy after traveling to ecbatana to retrieve the bulk of the persian treasure his closest friend and possible lover hephaestion died of an illness alexander was distraught and on his return to babylon he fell ill and died alexander s marriages and sexuality alexander s greatest emotional attachment is generally considered to have been to his companion cavalry commander chiliarchos and probable lover hephaestion they had most likely been best friends since childhood for hephaestion too received his education at the court of alexander s father hephaestion makes his appearance in history at the point when alexander reaches troy there the two friends made sacrifices at the shrines of the two heroes achilles and patroclus alexander honoring achilles and hephaestion honoring patroclus as aelian in his varia historia one two seven claims he thus intimated that he was the object of alexander s love as patroclus was of achilles following hephaestion s death alexander mourned him greatly and did not eat for days many have discussed alexander s ambiguous sexuality curtius reports that he scorned feminine sensual pleasures to such an extent that his mother was anxious lest he be unable to beget offspring to encourage a relationship with a woman king philip and olympias brought in a high priced thessalian courtesan named callixena later in life alexander married several princesses of former persian territories roxana of bactria statira daughter of darius iii and parysatis daughter of ochus he fathered two children heracles born by his concubine barsine the daughter of satrap artabazus of phrygia in three two seven bc and alexander iv of macedon born by roxana shortly after his death in three two three bc curtius maintains that alexander also took as a lover bagoas a eunuch exceptional in beauty and in the very flower of boyhood with whom darius was intimate and with whom alexander would later be intimate vi five two three bagoas is the only one who is actually named as the eromenos the beloved of alexander their relationship seems to have been well known among the troops as plutarch recounts an episode also mentioned by dicaearchus during some festivities on the way back from india in which his men clamor for him to openly kiss the young man bagoas sat down close by him which so pleased the macedonians that they made loud acclamations for him to kiss bagoas and never stopped clapping their hands and shouting till alexander put his arms round him and kissed him at this point in time the troops present were all survivors of the crossing of the desert bagoas must have endeared himself to them by his courage and fortitude during that harrowing episode whatever alexander s relationship with bagoas it was no impediment to relations with his queen six months after alexander s death roxana gave birth to his son and heir alexander iv besides bagoas curtius mentions yet another possible lover of alexander euxenippus whose youthful grace filled him with enthusiasm vii nine one nine allegations concerning alexander s sexuality remain highly controversial and excite passions in some quarters people of various national ethnic and cultural origins regard him as their hero some argue that historical accounts describing alexander s love for hephaestion and bagoas as sexual were written centuries after the fact and thus it can never be established what the historical relationship between alexander and his male companions were others argue that the same can be said about much of our information regarding alexander such debates however are generally considered anachronistic by scholars of the period who point out that the concept of homosexuality as understood today did not exist in greco roman antiquity sexual attraction between males was seen as a normal and universal part of human nature since it was believed that men were attracted to beauty an attribute of the young regardless of gender if alexander s love life was transgressive it was not for his love of beautiful youths but for his probable involvement with a man his own age in a time when the standard model of male love was pederastic see pederasty in ancient greece for more information the army of alexander the great before the battle of gaugamela the army of alexander was for the most part that of his father philip it was composed of light and heavy troops and some engineers medical and staff units about one third of the army was composed of his greek allies from the hellenic league infantry macedonian battle formation courtesy of the department of history united states military academy the main infantry corps was the phalanx composed of six regiments taxies numbering about two zero zero zero phalangites each each soldier had a long pike called a sarissa which was up to two one feet long and a short sword for protection the soldier wore a phrygian style helmet and a shield arrian mentions large shields the aspis but this is disputed as it is difficult to wield both a large pike and a large shield at the same time many modern historians claim the phalanx used a smaller shield called a pelta the shield used by peltasts it is unclear whether the phalanx used body armor but heavy body armor is mentioned in arrian one two eight seven and other ancient sources modern historians believe most of the phalangites did not wear heavy body armor at the time of alexander another important unit were the hypaspists shield bearers arranged into three battalions lochoi of one zero zero zero men each one of the battalions was named the agema and served as the king s bodyguards their armament is unknown and it is difficult to get a clear picture from ancient sources sometimes hypaspists are mentioned in the front line of the battle just between the phalanx and the heavy cavalry moreover they seem to have acted as an extension of the phalanx fighting as heavy infantry while keeping a link between the heavily clad phalangites and the companion cavalry they also accompanied alexander on flanking marches and were capable of fighting on rough terrain like light troops so it seems they could perform dual functions in addition to the units mentioned above the army included some six zero zero zero greek allied and mercenary hoplites also arranged in phalanxes they carried a shorter spear a dora which was six or seven feet long and a large aspis alexander also had light infantry units composed of peltasts psiloi and others peltasts are considered to be light infantry although they had a helmet and a small shield and were heavier than the psiloi the best peltasts were the agrianians from thrace cavalry the heavy cavalry included the companion cavalry raised from the macedonian nobility and the thessalian cavalry the companion cavalry hetairoi friends was divided into eight squadrons called ile two zero zero strong except the royal squadron of three zero zero they were equipped with a one two foot lance the xyston and heavy body armor the horses were partially clad in armor as well the riders did not carry shields as the xyston required both hands to wield the organization of the thessalian cavalry was similar to the companion cavalry but they had a shorter spear and fought in a looser formation of light cavalry the prodromoi forerunners secured the wings of the army during battle and went on reconnaissance missions several hundred allied horses rounded out the cavalry death contemporary bust of alexander the great on the afternoon of june one zero one one three two three bc alexander died of a mysterious illness in the palace of nebuchadrezzar ii of babylon he was just one month shy of attaining three three years of age various theories have been proposed for the cause of his death which include poisoning by the sons of antipater or others sickness that followed a drinking party or a relapse of the malaria he had contracted in three three six bc what is certain is that on may two nine alexander participated in a banquet organized by his friend medius of larissa after some heavy drinking immediately or after a bath he was forced to bed badly ill the troops started rumors more and more anxious and on june nine the generals decided to let the soldiers see their king alive one last time they were admitted to his presence one at a time while the king too ill to speak confined himself to move his hand the day after alexander was dead the poisoning theory derives from the story held in antiquity by justin and curtius the original story stated that cassander son of antipater viceroy of greece brought the poison to alexander in babylon in a mule s hoof and that alexander s royal cupbearer iollas brother of cassander administered it many had powerful motivations for seeing alexander gone and were none the worse for it after his death deadly agents that could have killed alexander in one or more doses include hellebore and strychnine in r lane fox s opinion the strongest argument against the poison theory is the fact that twelve days had passed between the start of his illness and his death and in the ancient world such long acting poisons were probably not available though this discounts the possibility of multiple doses however the warrior culture of macedon favored the sword over strychnine and many ancient historians like plutarch and arrian maintained that alexander was not poisoned but died of natural causes instead it is likely that alexander died of malaria or typhoid fever which were rampant in ancient babylon other illnesses could have also been the culprit including acute pancreatitis or the west nile virus recently theories have been advanced stating that alexander may have died from the treatment not the disease hellebore believed to have been widely used as a medicine at the time but deadly in large doses may have been overused by the impatient king to speed his recovery with deadly results disease related theories often cite the fact that alexander s health had fallen to dangerously low levels after years of heavy drinking and suffering several appalling wounds including one in india that nearly claimed his life and that it was only a matter of time before one sickness or another finally killed him no story is conclusive alexander s death has been reinterpreted many times over the centuries and each generation offers a new take on it what is certain is that alexander died of a high fever on june one zero or one one of three two three bc on his death bed his marshals asked him to whom he bequeathed his kingdom since alexander had only one heir it was a question of vital importance he answered famously the strongest before dying his final words were i foresee a great funeral contest over me alexander s funeral games where his marshals fought it out over control of his empire lasted for nearly forty years alexander s death has been surrounded by as much controversy as many of the events of his life before long accusations of foul play were being thrown about by his generals at one another making it incredibly hard for a modern historian to sort out the propaganda and the half truths from the actual events no contemporary source can be fully trusted because of the incredible level of self serving recording and as a result what truly happened to alexander the great may never be known alexander s body was placed in a gold anthropid sarcophagus which was in turn placed in a second gold casket and covered with a purple robe alexander s coffin was placed together with his armor in a gold carriage which had a vaulted roof supported by an ionic peristyle the decoration of the carriage was very rich and is described in great detail by diodoros according to legend alexander was preserved in a clay vessel full of honey which acts as a preservative and interred in a glass coffin according to aelian varia historia one two six four ptolemy stole the body and brought it to alexandria where it was on display until late antiquity it was here that ptolemy ix one of the last successors of ptolemy i replaced alexander s sarcophagus with a glass one and melted the original down in order to strike emergency gold issues of his coinage the citizens of alexandria were outraged at this and soon after ptolemy ix was killed its current whereabouts are unknown the so called alexander sarcophagus discovered near sidon and now in the istanbul archaeological museum is now generally thought to be that of abdylonymus whom hephaestion appointed as the king of sidon by alexander s order the sarcophagus depicts alexander and his companions hunting and in battle with the persians legacy and division of the empire coin of alexander bearing an aramaic language inscription after alexander s death his empire was divided among his officers mostly with the pretense of first preserving a united kingdom later his officers were focused on the explicit formation of rival monarchies and territorial states ultimately the conflict was settled after the battle of ipsus in phrygia in three zero one bc alexander s empire was divided at first into four major portions cassander ruled in macedon lysimachus in thrace seleucus in mesopotamia and iran and ptolemy in the levant and egypt antigonus ruled for a while in asia minor and syria but was eventually defeated by the other generals at ipsus three zero one bc control over indian territory was short lived when seleucus was defeated by chandragupta maurya the first mauryan emperor by two seven zero bc hellenistic states consolidated with the antigonid empire centered on macedon the seleucid empire in asia the ptolemaic kingdom in egypt palestine and cyrenaica by the one st century bc though most of the hellenistic territories in the west had been absorbed by the roman republic in the east they had been dramatically reduced by the expansion of the parthian empire and the secession of the greco bactrian kingdom alexander s conquests also had long term cultural effects with the flourishing of hellenistic civilization throughout the middle east and central asia and the development of greco buddhist art in the indian subcontinent influence on ancient rome a mural in pompeii depicting the marriage of alexander to barsine stateira in three two four bc the couple are apparently dressed as ares and aphrodite alexander and his exploits were admired by many romans who wanted to associate themselves with his achievements although very little is known about roman macedonian diplomatic relations of that time julius caesar wept in spain at the mere sight of alexander s statue and pompey the great rummaged through the closets of conquered nations for alexander s two six zero year old cloak which the roman general then wore as the costume of greatness however in his zeal to honor alexander octavian augustus accidentally broke the nose off the macedonian s mummified corpse while laying a wreath at the hero s shrine in alexandria egypt the unbalanced emperor caligula later took the dead king s armor from that tomb and donned it for luck the macriani a roman family that rose to the imperial throne in the three rd century a d always kept images of alexander on their persons either stamped into their bracelets and rings or stitched into their garments even their dinnerware bore alexander s face with the story of the king s life displayed around the rims of special bowls in the summer of one nine nine five during the archaeological work of the season centered on excavating the remains of domestic architecture of early roman date a statue of alexander was recovered from the structure which was richly decorated with mosaic and marble pavements and probably was constructed in the one st century a d and occupied until the three rd century notes one frank l holt alexander the great and the mystery of the elephant medallions university of california press two salima ikram nile currents general timeline alexander s character equestrian statue of alexander the great on the waterfront at thessaloniki capital of greek macedonia modern opinion on alexander has run the gamut from the idea that he believed he was on a divinely inspired mission to unite the human race to the view that he was a megalomaniac bent on world domination such views tend to be anachronistic however and the sources allow for a variety of interpretations much about alexander s personality and aims remains enigmatic alexander is remembered as a legendary hero in europe and much of both southwest asia and central asia where he is known as iskander or iskandar zulkarnain to zoroastrians on the other hand he is remembered as the destroyer of their first great empire and as the leveller of persepolis ancient sources are generally written with an agenda of either glorifying or denigrating the man making it difficult to evaluate his actual character most refer to a growing instability and megalomania in the years following gaugamela but it has been suggested that this simply reflects the greek stereotype of an orientalizing king the murder of his friend clitus which alexander deeply and immediately regretted is often cited as a sign of his paranoia as is his execution of philotas and his general parmenion for failure to pass along details of a plot against him however this may have been more prudence than paranoia modern alexandrists continue to debate these same issues among others in modern times one unresolved topic involves whether alexander was actually attempting to better the world by his conquests or whether his purpose was primarily to rule the world partially in response to the ubiquity of positive portrayals of alexander an alternate character is sometimes presented which emphasizes some of alexander s negative aspects some proponents of this view cite the destructions of thebes tyre persepolis and gaza as examples of atrocities and argue that alexander preferred to fight rather than negotiate it is further claimed in response to the view that alexander was generally tolerant of the cultures of those whom he conquered that his attempts at cultural fusion were severely practical and that he never actually admired persian art or culture to this way of thinking alexander was first and foremost a general rather than a statesman alexander s character also suffers from the interpretation of historians who themselves are subject to the bias and idealisms of their own time good examples are w w tarn who wrote during the late one nine th century and early two zero th century and who saw alexander in an extremely good light and peter green who wrote after world war ii and for whom alexander did little that was not inherently selfish or ambition driven tarn wrote in an age where world conquest and warrior heroes were acceptable even encouraged whereas green wrote with the backdrop of the holocaust and nuclear weapons as a result alexander s character is skewed depending on which way the historian s own culture is and further muddles the debate of who he truly was stories and legends according to one story the philosopher anaxarchus checked the vainglory of alexander when he aspired to the honors of divinity by pointing to alexander s wound saying see the blood of a mortal not the ichor of a god in another version alexander himself pointed out the difference in response to a sycophantic soldier a strong oral tradition although not attested in any extant primary source lists alexander as having epilepsy known to the greeks as the sacred disease and thought to be a mark of divine favor alexander had a legendary horse named bucephalus meaning ox headed supposedly descended from the mares of diomedes alexander himself while still a young boy tamed this horse after experienced horse trainers failed to do so there is an apocryphal tale appearing in a redaction of the pseudo historical alexander romance which details another end for the last true pharaoh of egypt soon after alexander s divinity was confirmed by the oracle of zeus ammon a rumor was begun that nectanebo ii did not travel to nubia but instead to the court of philip ii of macedon in the guise of an egyptian magician he coupled with phillip s wife olympias and from his issue came alexander this myth would hold strong appeal for egyptians who desired continuity in rule and harbored a strong dislike for foreign rule another legend tells of alexander s campaign down into the syrian world toward egypt on the way he planned to lay siege to the city of jerusalem as the victorious armies of the greeks approached the city word was brought to the jews in jerusalem that the armies were on their way the high priest at that time who was a godly old man by the name of jaddua mentioned also in the bible book of nehemiah took the sacred writings of daniel the prophet and accompanied by a host of other priests dressed in white garments went forth and met alexander some distance outside the city all this is from the report of josephus the jewish historian who tells us that alexander left his army and hurried to meet this body of priests when he met them he told the high priest that he had had a vision the night before in which god had shown him an old man robed in a white garment who would show him something of great significance to himself according to the account the high priest then opened the prophecies of daniel and read them to alexander in the prophecies alexander was able to see the predictions that he would become that notable goat with the horn in his forehead who would come from the west and smash the power of persia and conquer the world he was so overwhelmed by the accuracy of this prophecy and of course by the fact that it spoke about him that he promised that he would save jerusalem from siege and sent the high priest back with honors ancient sources the ancient sources for alexander s life are from the perspective of ancient history relatively numerous alexander himself left only a few inscriptions and some letter fragments of dubious authenticity but a large number of his contemporaries wrote full accounts the key contemporary historians are considered callisthenes his general ptolemy aristobulus nearchus and onesicritus another influential account was penned by cleitarchus who while not a direct witness of alexander s expedition used the sources which had just been published his work was to be the backbone of that of timagenes who heavily influenced many surviving historians unfortunately all these works were lost instead the modern historian must rely on authors who used these and other early sources the five main accounts are by arrian curtius plutarch diodorus and justin anabasis alexandri the campaigns of alexander in greek by the greek historian arrian of nicomedia writing in the two nd century ad and based largely on ptolemy and to a lesser extent aristobulus and nearchus it is considered generally the most trustworthy source historiae alexandri magni a biography of alexander in ten books of which the last eight survive by the roman historian quintus curtius rufus written in the one st century ad and based largely on cleitarchus through the mediation of timagenes with some material probably from ptolemy life of alexander see parallel lives and two orations on the fortune or the virtue of alexander the great see moralia by the greek historian and biographer plutarch of chaeronea in the second century based largely on aristobulus and especially cleitarchus bibliotheca historia library of world history written in greek by the sicilian historian diodorus siculus from which book one seven relates the conquests of alexander based almost entirely on timagenes s work the books immediately before and after on philip and alexander s successors throw light on alexander s reign the epitome of the philippic history of pompeius trogus by justin which contains factual errors and is highly compressed it is difficult in this case to understand the source since we only have an epitome but it is thought that also pompeius trogus may have limited himself to use timagenes for his latin history to these five main sources some like to add the metz epitome an anonymous late latin work that narrates alexander s campaigns from hyrcania to india much is also recounted incidentally in other authors including strabo athenaeus polyaenus aelian and others the problem of the sources is the main concern and chief delight of alexander historians in effect each presents a different alexander with details to suit arrian is mostly interested in the military aspects while curtius veers to a more private and darker alexander plutarch can t resist a good story light or dark all with the possible exception of arrian include a considerable level of fantasy prompting strabo to remark all who wrote about alexander preferred the marvellous to the true nevertheless the sources tell us much and leave much to our interpretation and imagination alexander s legend alexander was a legend in his own time his court historian callisthenes portrayed the sea in cilicia as drawing back from him in proskynesis writing after alexander s death another participant onesicritus went so far as to invent a tryst between alexander and thalestris queen of the mythical amazons when onesicritus read this passage to his patron alexander s general and later king lysimachus lysimachus reportedly quipped i wonder where i was at the time in the first centuries after alexander s death probably in alexandria a quantity of the more legendary material coalesced into a text known as the alexander romance later falsely ascribed to the historian callisthenes and therefore known as pseudo callisthenes this text underwent numerous expansions and revisions throughout antiquity and the middle ages exhibiting a plasticity unseen in higher literary forms latin and syriac translations were made in late antiquity from these versions were developed in all the major languages of europe and the middle east including armenian georgian persian arabic turkish hebrew serbian slavonic romanian hungarian german english italian and french the romance is regarded by most western scholars as the source of the account of alexander given in the qur an sura the cave it is the source of many incidents in ferdowsi s shahnama a mongolian version is also extant some believe that excepting certain religious texts it is the most widely read work of pre modern times alexander s legend in non western sources alexander was often identified in persian and arabic language sources as dhul qarnayn arabic for the two horned one possibly a reference to the appearance of a horn headed figure that appears on coins minted during his rule and later imitated in ancient middle eastern coinage if this theory is followed islamic accounts of the alexander legend particularly in the qur an and in persian legends combined the pseudo callisthenes legendary pseudo religious material about alexander the same legends from the pseudo callisthenes were combined in persia with sasanid persian ideas about alexander in the

humankind mankind as a time binding class of life general semantics korzybski s work culminated in the founding of a discipline that he called general semantics gs as korzybski explicitly said gs should not be confused with semantics a different subject the basic principles of general semantics which include time binding are outlined in science and sanity published in one nine three three in one nine three eight korzybski founded the institute of general semantics and directed it until his death in simplified form the essence of korzybski s work was the claim that human beings are limited in what they know by one the structure of their nervous systems and two the structure of their languages human beings cannot experience the world directly but only through their abstractions nonverbal impressions or gleanings derived from the nervous system and verbal indicators expressed and derived from language sometimes our perceptions and our languages actually mislead us as to the facts with which we must deal our understanding of what is going on sometimes lacks similarity of structure with what is actually going on he stressed training in awareness of abstracting using techniques that he had derived from his study of mathematics and science he called this awareness this goal of his system consciousness of abstracting his system included modifying the way we approach the world e g with an attitude of i don t know let s see to better discover or reflect its realities as shown by modern science one of these techniques involved becoming inwardly and outwardly quiet an experience that he called silence on the objective levels korzybski and to be it is often said that korzybski opposed the use of the verb to be an unfortunate exaggeration he thought that certain uses of the verb to be called the is of identity and the is of predication were faulty in structure e g a statement such as joe is a fool said of a person named joe who has done something that we regard as dumb korzybski s remedy was to deny identity in this example to be continually aware that joe is not what we call him we find joe not in the verbal domain the world of words but the nonverbal domain this was expressed in korzybski s most famous premise the map is not the territory note that the map is not the territory uses the phrase is not a form of the verb to be this example shows that he did not intend to abandon the verb as such anecdote about korzybski one day korzybski was giving a lecture to a group of students and he suddenly interrupted the lesson in order to retrieve a packet of biscuits wrapped in white paper from his briefcase he muttered that he just had to eat something and he asked the students on the seats in the front row if they would also like a biscuit a few students took a biscuit nice biscuit don t you think said korzybski while he took a second one the students were chewing vigorously then he tore the white paper from the biscuits in order to reveal the original packaging on it was a big picture of a dog s head and the words dog cookies the students looked at the package and were shocked two of them wanted to throw up put their hands in front of their mouths and ran out of the lecture hall to the toilet you see ladies and gentlemen korzybski remarked i have just demonstrated that people don t just eat food but also words and that the taste of the former is often outdone by the taste of the latter apparently his prank aimed to illustrate how human suffering originates from the confusion or conflation of linguistic representations of reality and reality itself source r diekstra haarlemmer dagblad one nine nine three cited by l derks j hollander essenties van nlp utrecht servire one nine nine six p five eight impact korzybski s work

is a popular vector based video arcade game released in one nine seven nine by atari the object of the game is for the player to shoot and destroy asteroids without being hit by the fragments it was one of the most popular and influential games of the golden age of arcade games description asteroids was inspired in a roundabout way by the seminal spacewar the first computer based video game in the early one nine eight zero s a stand up arcade game version was produced as space wars which included a number of optional versions and added a floating asteroid as a visual device asteroids is essentially a one player version of spacewar featuring the wedge ship from the original and promoting the asteroids to be the main opponent the game was conceived by lyle rains and programmed by ed logg asteroids was a hit in the united states and became one of atari s best selling games of all time atari had been in the process of releasing a vector beam version of lunar lander but demand for asteroids was so high they simply pulled them apart and converted them over today the lunar lander version is difficult to find asteroids was so popular that video arcade owners usually had to install larger boxes to hold all the coins this machine raked in one feature of the game was the ability for players to record their initials with their high scores an innovation which is standard in arcade games to this day asteroids was the first of several games to use atari s quadra scan vector refresh system although a raster based full color version was developed for the atari two six zero zero home video game system later full color quadra scan games would include tempest features the player s controls consisted of thrust and fire buttons and rotate left rotate right buttons actually rotate counterclockwise and rotate clockwise respectively the momentum of the player s ship was not conserved and it would start to slow down if thrust was not applied there was also a hyperspace button which randomly teleported the player s ship somewhere on the screen with the risk of exploding upon rematerialization or rematerializing inside an asteroid the player s ship spawned in the middle of the screen with four large asteroids drifting around each large asteroid two zero points would break into two medium sized ones five zero points when shot which in turn would break into two small one zero zero points asteroids the medium and small asteroids once spawned could travel at widely varying speeds periodically one of two types of flying saucers ufos would fly onto the screen the big one worth two zero zero points would shoot in random directions while the small one one zero zero zero points would attempt to aim at the player they tended to appear more often when few asteroids remained on the screen and or the player hadn t shot an asteroid recently the screen wrapped around allowing the player s ship as well as asteroids and shots but not saucers to fly off the one edge of the screen and reappear on the opposite side once a level had been cleared of all asteroids and ufos a new set of large asteroids would appear increasing by two each round up to a maximum of one two the maximum score possible was nine nine nine nine zero points after which it turned back over to zero a player who desired to get onto the top score list then had to be careful to shoot just enough asteroids ufos to reach this score without going over including committing suicide with the last ship left to reach the final total on some early versions of the game it was possible to hide the ship in the score area indefinitely without being hit by asteroids lurking the small ufo is the key to high scores for many advanced players soon after the release of asteroids some players discovered that small ufos would be continually sent out when the asteroid count decreased to a certain level since these ufos were worth one zero zero zero points each a significant sum on this game a strategy known as lurking soon developed around this players would shoot asteroids until there was only one small or mid sized rock remaining and then maneuver the ship to a spot approximately one inch from any corner of the screen small ufos would then be ambushed as soon as they emerged and before they were able to return fire using wraparound fire if necessary because the small ufos were unable to lead the player s ship with their fire i e aiming ahead of the ship s flight path a clever player could manuever if necessary in such a way as to virtually ensure they would never be hit by the small ufo in fact the large ufo in a sense was seen as more of a threat precisely because of its unpredictable random shots since each one zero zero zero zero points awarded an extra life players could continue almost indefinitely once the practice had been mastered the designers abolished this practice in asteroids deluxe by causing the ufos to either shoot at the remaining asteroids thus ending the round or shoot at the player as soon as they appeared on the screen they also gained the ability to lead the player s ship as well making them much more dangerous however it was also possible to succeed by shooting the asteroids instead a shrewd asteroid hunting player would typically attempt to kill all the asteroids inside a large one before shooting another asteroid thus minimizing the amount of clutter on the screen technical description the asteroids arcade machine is a so called vector game this means that the game graphics are composed entirely of lines which are drawn on a vector monitor the hardware consists primarily of a standard mos six five zero two cpu which executes the game program and the digital vector generator dvg vector processing circuitry developed by atari themselves as the six five zero two by itself was too slow to control both the game play and the vector hardware at the same time the latter task was delegated to the dvg for each picture frame the six five zero two writes graphics commands for the dvg into a defined area of ram the vector ram and then asks the dvg to draw the corresponding vector image on the screen the dvg reads the commands and generates appropriate signals for the vector monitor there are dvg commands for positioning the cathode ray for drawing a line to a specified destination calling a subroutine with further commands and so on asteroids also features various sound effects each of which is implemented by its own circuitry the cpu activates these audio circuits and other hardware components by writing to special memory addresses memory mapped ports the inputs from the player s controls buttons are also mapped into the cpu address space the main asteroids game program uses only four kb of rom code another four kb of vector rom contain the descriptions of the main graphical elements rocks saucer player s ship explosion pictures letters and digits in the form of dvg commands legacy the gameplay in asteroids was imitated by many games that followed for example one of the objects of sinistar is to shoot asteroids in order to get them to release resources which the player needs to collect due to its success asteroids was followed by three sequels asteroids deluxe one nine eight zero space duel one nine eight two blasteroids one nine eight seven however the original game was by far the most popular of the series the killer list of videogames klov credits this game as one of the top one zero zero videogames readers of the klov credit it as the seventh most popular game ports being one of the most popular video games ever asteroids has been ported to multiple systems including many of atari s systems atari two six zero zero five two zero zero seven eight zero zero atari lynx and many others the two six zero zero port was the first game to utilize a bank switched cartridge doubling available rom space also a new version of asteroids was developed for playstation nintendo six four windows and the game boy color in the late one nine nine zero s a port was also included on atari s cosmos system but the system never saw release many of the recent tv games series of old atari games have included either the two six zero zero or arcade versions of asteroids atari has also used the game for its other late nine zero s anthology series essentially if one looks for this game one will be able to find it somewhere in two zero zero five asteroids including both atari two six zero zero and the arcade original along with asteroids deluxe were included as part of atari anthology for both

woody plants in older classification systems the families now included in the asparagales were included in order liliales and some genera of which were even included in family liliaceae some classification systems separate some of the families listed below into additional orders including orders orchidales and iridales while other systems especially the angiosperm phylogeny group s classification system include the orchidales and iridales within the asparagales the order is named after the genus asparagus the angiosperm phylogeny group s classification system is widely used by botanists and was updated as the apg ii in two zero zero two to include recent findings especially in dna analysis their one nine nine eight scheme identified two nine families in order asparagales the apg ii consolidates some families and recognizes an alternative system of fewer larger families in which certain smaller families can be grouped within other larger families based on close genetic affinities and still follow the apg system under the new classification system one could for example correctly include daylilies hemerocallis in family hemerocallidaceae or in family xanthorrhoeaceae the apg ii classification of the asparagales is as follows alliaceae agapanthaceae amaryllidaceae asparagaceae agavaceae aphyllanthaceae hesperocallidaceae hyacinthaceae laxmanniaceae ruscaceae

comprised of herbaceous non succulent plants these plants are commonly found in aquatic environmments the flowers are usually arranged in inflorescences and the mature seeds lack endosperm traditionally the order alismatales was restricted to contain just three families alismataceae butomaceae and limnocharitaceae the other families were not considered as alismatids and were assigned to various distinct orders but this approach produced polyphyletic groups and so the whole group of families is now placed into a single order the petrosaviaceae have been placed in this order but their

the order is cosmopolitic and includes mostly herbaceous species although a small number of trees lobelia and shrubs is also present the asterales can be characterized on the morphological and molecular level synapomorphies include the oligosaccharide inulin as the nutrients storage and the stamens are usually aggregated densely around the style or even are fused into a tube around it the last property is probably associated with the plunger or secondary pollination which is common among the families of the order families the asterales include about eleven families the largest of which is asteraceae with about two five zero zero zero species and campanulaceae with about two zero zero zero species the remaining families count together for less than five zero zero species the two

the characteristics of their orbits and on the details of the spectrum of sunlight they reflect orbit groups and families main articles asteroid family and minor planet many asteroids have been placed in groups and families based on their orbital characteristics it is customary to name a group of asteroids after the first member of that group to be discovered groups are relatively loose dynamical associations whereas families are much tighter and result from the catastrophic break up of a large parent asteroid sometime in the past for a full listing of known asteroid groups and families see minor planet and asteroid family spectral classification two five three mathilde a c type asteroid in one nine seven five an asteroid taxonomic system based on colour albedo and spectral shape was developed by clark r chapman david morrison and ben zellner these properties are thought to correspond to the composition of the asteroid s surface material originally they classified only three types of asteroids c type asteroids carbonaceous seven five of known asteroids s type asteroids silicaceous one seven of known asteroids m type asteroids metallic most of the remaining asteroids this list has since been expanded to include a number of other asteroid types the number of types continues to grow as more asteroids are studied see asteroid spectral types for more detail or for a list note that the proportion of known asteroids falling into the various spectral types does not necessarily reflect the proportion of all asteroids that are of that type some types are easier to detect than others biasing the totals problems with spectral classification originally spectral designations were based on inferences of an asteroid s composition c carbonaceous s silicaceous m metallic however the correspondence between spectral class and composition is not always very good and there are a variety of classifications in use this has led to significant confusion while asteroids of different spectral classifications are likely to be composed of different materials there are no assurances that asteroids within the same taxonomic class are composed of similar materials at present the spectral classification based on several coarse resolution spectroscopic surveys in the one nine nine zero s is still the standard scientists have been unable to agree on a better taxonomic system largely due to the difficulty of obtaining detailed measurements consistently for a large sample of asteroids e g finer resolution spectra or non spectral data such as densities would be very useful asteroid discovery historical discovery methods asteroid discovery methods have drastically improved over the past two centuries in the last years of the one eight th century baron franz xaver von zach organized a group of two four astronomers to search the sky for the missing planet predicted at about two eight au from the sun by the titius bode law partly as a consequence of the discovery by sir william herschel in one seven eight one of the planet uranus at the distance predicted by the law this task required that hand drawn sky charts be prepared for all stars in the zodiacal band down to an agreed upon limit of faintness on subsequent nights the sky would be charted again and any moving object would hopefully be spotted the expected motion of the missing planet was about three zero seconds of arc per hour readily discernable by observers ironically the first asteroid one ceres was not discovered by a member of the group but rather by accident in one eight zero one by giuseppe piazzi director at the time of the observatory of palermo in sicily he discovered a new star like object in taurus and followed the displacement of this object during several nights his colleague carl friedrich gauss used these observations to determine the exact distance from this unknown object to the earth gauss calculations placed the object between the planets mars and jupiter piazzi named it after ceres the roman goddess of agriculture three other asteroids two pallas three juno four vesta were discovered over the next few years with vesta found in one eight zero seven after eight more years of fruitless searches most astronomers assumed that there were no more and abandoned any further searches however karl ludwig hencke persisted and began searching for more asteroids in one eight three zero fifteen years later he found five astraea the first new asteroid in three eight years he also found six hebe less than two years later after this other astronomers joined in the search and at least one new asteroid was discovered every year after that except the wartime year one nine four five notable asteroid hunters of this early era were j r hind annibale de gasparis robert luther h m s goldschmidt jean chacornac james ferguson norman robert pogson e w tempel j c watson c h f peters a borrelly j palisa paul henry and prosper henry and auguste charlois in one eight nine one however max wolf pioneered the use of astrophotography to detect asteroids which appeared as short streaks on long exposure photographic plates this drastically increased the rate of detection compared with previous visual methods wolf alone discovered two four eight asteroids beginning with three two three brucia whereas only slightly more than three zero zero had been discovered up to that point still a century later only a few thousand asteroids were identified numbered and named it was known that there were many more but most astronomers did not bother with them calling them vermin of the skies modern discovery methods until one nine nine eight asteroids were discovered by a four step process first a region of the sky was photographed by a wide field telescope pairs of photographs were taken typically one hour apart multiple pairs could be taken over a series of days second the two films of the same region were viewed under a stereoscope any body in orbit around the sun would move slightly between the pair of films under the stereoscope the image of the body would appear to float slightly above the background of stars third once a moving body was identified its location would be measured precisely using a digitizing microscope the location would be measured relative to known star locations these first three steps do not constitute asteroid discovery the observer has only found an apparition which gets a provisional designation made up of the year of discovery a code of two letters representing the week of discovery and of a number so more than the one discovered one took place in this week example one nine nine eight fj seven four the final step of discovery is to send the locations and time of observations to brian marsden of the minor planet center dr marsden has computer programs that compute whether an apparition ties together previous apparitions into a single orbit if so the object gets a number the observer of the first apparition with a calculated orbit is declared the discoverer and he gets the honour of naming the asteroid subject to the approval of the international astronomical union once it is numbered latest technology detecting hazardous asteroids there is increasing interest in identifying asteroids whose orbits cross earth s orbit and that could given enough time collide with earth see earth crosser asteroids the three most important groups of near earth asteroids are the apollos amors and the atens various asteroid deflection strategies have been proposed the near earth asteroid four three three eros had been discovered as long ago as one eight nine eight and the one nine three zero s brought a flurry of similar objects in order of discovery these were one two two one amor one eight six two apollo two one zero one adonis and finally six nine two three zero hermes which approached within zero zero zero five au of the earth in one nine three seven astronomers began to realize the possibilities of earth impact two events in later decades increased the level of alarm the increasing acceptance of walter alvarez theory of dinosaur extinction being due to an impact event and the one nine nine four observation of comet shoemaker levy nine crashing into jupiter the u s military also declassified the information that its military satellites built to detect nuclear explosions had detected hundreds of upper atmosphere impacts by objects ranging from one to one zero metres across all of these considerations helped spur the launch of highly efficient automated systems that consist of charge coupled device ccd cameras and computers directly connected to telescopes since one nine nine eight a large majority of the asteroids have been discovered by such automated systems a list of teams using such automated systems includes the lincoln near earth asteroid research linear team the near earth asteroid tracking neat team spacewatch the lowell observatory near earth object search loneos team the catalina sky survey css the campo imperatore near earth objects survey cineos team the japanese spaceguard association the asiago dlr asteroid survey adas the linear system alone has discovered six two two eight three asteroids as of december one four two zero zero five between all of the automated systems three eight six eight near earth asteroids have been discovered including over six zero zero more than one km in diameter naming asteroids the naming format newly discovered asteroids are given a provisional designation consisting of the year of discovery and an alphanumeric code such as two zero zero one fh when its orbit is confirmed it is given a number and later may also be given a name e g one ceres the formal naming convention uses parentheses around the number e g four three three eros however dropping the parentheses is quite common informally especially when a name is repeated in running text it is common to drop the number altogether or to drop it after the first mention the minor planet circular mpc of october one nine two zero zero five was a historical one as it saw the highest numbered asteroid jump from nine nine nine four seven to one one eight one six one causing a small y two k like crisis for various automated data services up until then only five digits were allowed in most data formats for the asteroid number this has been addressed in some data fields by having the leftmost digit the ten thousands place use the alphabet as a digit extension a one zero b one one z three five a three six z six one the highest number one two zero four three seven thus is cross referenced as c zero four three seven on some lists also the fictional asteroid of the little prince b six one two now could be connected with the real one one

designation e g two nine zero seven five one nine five zero da as modern discovery techniques have discovered vast numbers of new asteroids they are increasingly being left unnamed the first asteroid to be left unnamed was three three six zero one nine eight one va on rare occasions an asteroid s provisional designation may become used as a name in itself the still unnamed one five seven six zero one nine nine two qb gave its name to a group of asteroids which became known as cubewanos sources for names the first few asteroids were named after figures from graeco roman mythology but as such names started to run out others were used famous people literary characters the names of the discoverer s wives children and even television characters the first asteroid to be given a non mythological name was two zero massalia named after the city of marseilles for some time only female or feminized names were used alexander von humboldt was the first man to have an asteroid named after him but his name was feminized to five four alexandra this unspoken tradition lasted until three three four chicago was named even then oddly feminised names show up in the list for years afterward as the number of asteroids began to run into the hundreds and eventually the thousands discoverers began to give them increasingly frivolous names the first hints of this were four eight two petrina and four eight three seppina named after the discoverer s pet dogs however there was little controversy about this until one nine seven one upon the naming of two three zero nine mr spock which was not even named after the star trek character but after the discoverer s cat who supposedly bore a resemblance to him although the iau subsequently banned pet names as sources eccentric asteroid names are still being proposed and accepted such as six zero four two cheshirecat nine zero zero seven james bond or two six eight five eight misterrogers for a full list see meanings of asteroid names special naming rules asteroid naming is not always a free for all there are some types of asteroid for which rules have developed about the sources of names for instance centaurs asteroids orbiting between saturn and neptune are all named after mythological centaurs trojans after heroes from the trojan war and trans neptunian objects after underworld spirits asteroid symbols the first few asteroids discovered were assigned symbols like the ones traditionally used to designate earth the moon the sun and planets the symbols quickly became ungainly hard to draw and recognise by the end of one eight five one there were one five known asteroids each except one with its own symbol the first four s main variants are shown here one ceres old planetary symbol of ceres variant

speak out formally in the field of apologetics allocution is generally done in defense of a belief in politics one may allocute before a legislative body in an effort to influence their position on an issue in law it is generally meant to state specifically and in detail what one did and or why often in relation to commission of a crime in most jurisdictions a defendant is allowed the opportunity to allocute that is explain himself before sentence is passed some jurisdictions hold this as an absolute right and in its absence a sentence may potentially be overturned with the result that a new sentencing hearing must be held allocution is sometimes required of a defendant who pleads guilty to a crime in a plea bargain in exchange for a reduced sentence in this instance allocution can serve to provide closure for victims or their families in principle it removes any doubt as to the exact nature of the defendant s guilt in the matter however there have been many cases in which the defendant allocuted to a crime that he did not commit often because this is a requirement to receiving a lesser sentence the term allocution is generally only in use in jurisdictions in the united states though there are similar processes in other nations see also confession law an affidavit is a formal sworn statement of fact written down signed and witnessed as to the veracity of the signature by a taker of oaths such as a notary public the name is medieval latin for he has declared upon oath one use of affidavits is to allow evidence to be gathered from witnesses or participants that may not be available to testify in person before the court in american jurisprudence it is very unusual to allow an unsupported affidavit to be entered into evidence as the person sworn in the affidavit is not subject to cross examination with regard to material facts which may be dispositive of the matter at bar affidavits from persons who are dead or otherwise incapacitated or who cannot be located or made to appear may be accepted by the court but usually only in the presence of corroborating evidence a formerly written affidavit which reflected a better grasp of the facts closer in

accompanied by an independent sworn statement or other evidence in support of the need for the motion in such a case the court will accept an affidavit from the filing attorney in support of the motion as certain assumptions are made to wit the affidavit in place of sworn testimony promotes judicial economy the lawyer is an officer of the court and knows that a false swearing by him if found

modern society reflecting the qualities of aquarius most astrologers believe that this era has begun mass production electricity flight and space travel electronic communications including computers

and background styles which may be created by hand or may be assisted by computers storylines may feature a variety of characters and may be set in different locations and in different eras anime is aimed at a broad range of audiences because there are a wide range of different genres that any series may be categorised under anime may be broadcast on television distributed on media such as dvds or published as console and computer games anime is often influenced by japanese comics known as manga anime may also be adapted into live action television programs a scene from cowboy bebop one nine nine eight toc history atom star of the long running science fiction series mighty atom also known as astro boy to western audiences the history of anime begins at the start of the two zero th century when japanese filmmakers experimented with the animation techniques that were being explored in the west during the one nine seven zero s anime developed further separating itself from its western roots and developing unique genres such as mecha in the one nine eight zero s anime was accepted in the mainstream in japan and experienced a boom in production the one nine nine zero s and two zero zero zero s saw an increased acceptance of anime in overseas markets terminology the japanese term for animation is anim shon pronounced written in katakana it is a direct transliteration and reborrowed loanword of the english term animation the japanese term is abbreviated as anime pronounced both the original and abbreviated forms are valid and interchangeable in japanese but as could be expected the abbreviated form is more commonly used the term is a broad one and does not specify an animation s nation of origin or style pronunciation the english word anime is a transliteration of the abbreviated version of this japanese term and it is typically pronounced as or ann ih may ah nee may is a less common variant some theorize the word comes from the french anim animated or les dessins anim s animated drawings and pronounce it as ah nee may though the japanese themselves deny this theory and the fact that it is written in japanese syllables as anime rather than animei further lowers its credibility as with a few other japanese words such as pok mon and kobo ab anime is sometimes spelled as anim in english with an acute accent over the final e to cue the reader that the letter is pronounced as hence the pronunciations ah neem and uh neem are generally considered incorrect syntax anime can be used as a common noun do you watch anime or as a suppletive adjective the anime guyver is different from the movie guyver it may also be used as a mass noun as in how much anime have you collected and therefore is never pluralized animes nouns are never pluralized in japanese synonyms anime is sometimes referred to by the blend word japanimation but this term has fallen into disuse it saw the most usage during the one nine seven zero s and one nine eight zero s which broadly comprise the first and second waves of anime fandom the term survived at least into the early one nine nine zero s but seemed to fade away shortly before the mid one nine nine zero s anime resurgence in general the term now only appears in nostalgic contexts the term is much more commonly used within japan to refer to domestic animation since anime or anim shon is used to describe all forms of animation japanimation is used to distinguish japanese work from that of the rest of the world in more recent years anime has also frequently been referred to as manga in europe a practice that may stem from the japanese usage in japan manga can refer to both animation and comics although the use of manga to refer to animation is mostly restricted to non fans among english speakers manga usually has the stricter meaning of japanese comics an alternate explanation is that it is due to the prominence of manga entertainment a distributor of anime to the us and uk markets because manga entertainment started out in the uk this use of the term is much more common in europe characteristics dragon ball z is one of the most popular sh nen anime anime features a wide variety of artistic styles which vary from artist to artist and is characterized by stark colorful graphics and stylized colorful images depicting vibrant characters in a variety of different settings and storylines aimed at a wide range of audiences genres anime has many genres with as many as traditional live action cinema such genres include adventure science fiction children s stories romance medieval fantasy erotica hentai occult horror action and drama most anime includes content from several different genres as well as a variety of thematic elements this can make categorizing some titles very difficult a show may have a seemingly simple surface plot but at the same time may feature a far more complex deeper storyline and character development it is not uncommon for a strongly action themed anime to also involve humor romance and even poignant social commentary the same can be applied to a romance themed anime in that it may involve a strong action element genres and designations that are specific to anime and manga for other possible genres see list of movie genres bish jo japanese for beautiful girl blanket term that can be used to describe any anime that features pretty girl characters for example magic knight rayearth bish nen japanese for beautiful boy blanket term that can be used to describe any anime that features pretty and elegant boys and men for example fushigi y gi ecchi japanese for indecent sexuality contains mild sexual humor for example love hina hentai japanese for abnormal or perverted and used by western audiences to refer to pornographic anime or erotica however in japan the term used to refer to the same material is typically poruno or ero josei japanese for young woman this is anime or manga that is aimed at young women and is one of the rarest forms kodomo japanese for child this is anime or manga that is aimed at young children for example doraemon mecha anime or manga featuring giant robots example mobile suit gundam mo anime or manga featuring characters that are extremely perky or cute for example little snow fairy sugar progressive art films or extremely stylized anime for example voices of a distant star seinen anime or manga similar to sh nen but targeted at teenage or young male adults for example oh my goddess sentai super sentai literally fighting team in japanese refers to any show that involves a superhero team for example cyborg zero zero nine sh jo japanese for young lady or little girl refers to anime or manga targeted at girls for example fruits basket mah sh jo subgenre of shoujo known for magical girl stories for example sailor moon sh jo ai japanese for girl love refers to anime or manga that focus on love and romance between female characters for example revolutionary girl utena sh nen japanese for boys refers to anime or manga targeted at boys for example dragon ball z sh nen ai japanese for boy love refers to anime or manga that focus on love and romance between male characters this term is being phased out in japan due to references to pedophilia and is being replaced by the term boys love bl an example of this style is gravitation some anime titles are written for a very specific audience even narrower than those described above for example initial d and x driver concern street racing and car tuning ashita no joe is about boxing hanaukyo maid team is based on the french maid fantasy recently the national child exploitation coordination centre of canada has incorrectly classified all anime as hentai giving an improper impression of the content of most anime and manga series this occurred despite having linked to this wikipedia page in order to establish a definition of terms the site can be viewed at the following link complaints about the article s content and improper citations caused the ncecc to revise the citations but not the content music much like western live action cinema anime uses music as an important artistic tool anime soundtracks are big business in japan and are often times met with similar demand as chart topping pop albums it is for this reason that anime music is often composed and performed by a list musicians stars and composers skilled bgm composers are highly respected in the anime fan community anime series with opening credits use the opening theme song as a quick introduction to the show the most frequent use of music in anime is background music or bgm bgm is used to set the tone of a given scene for example neon genesis evangelion s decisive battle is played when the characters are making battle preparations and it features heavy drum beats and a militaristic style which highlights the tension of the scene and hints at the action to follow the theme song also referred to as the opening song or abbreviated as op usually matches the overall tone of the show and serves to get the viewer excited about the upcoming program insert songs and ending songs abbr ed often make commentary about the plot or the program as a whole and are often times used to highlight a particularly important scene opening and ending themes as well as insert songs are frequently performed by popular musicians or japanese idols so in this way songs become a very important component of an anime program in addition to the themes the seiy for a specific anime also frequently releases cd for their character called image albums despite the word image in the cd s name it only contains music and or voice messages where the seiy talks with the audience or about herself making the listener think that the character him herself is singing another type of anime cds release are drama cd featuring songs and tracks which makes use of the seiy to tell a story often not included in the main anime animation style lum from urusei yatsura an iconic anime character the drawing style used in anime is counter productive to the animation process having far too many details and subsequently making it difficult to keep the number of drawings comparable to other cartoons with design ethics that stress simplicity this may be due to a philosophy of applying more effort into each of a few drawings than less effort into one of many osamu tezuka adapted and simplified many disney animation precepts to reduce the budget costs and number of frames in the production though it should be noted that disney films made in the west are not anime this was intended to be a temporary measure to allow him to produce one episode every week with an inexperienced animation staff anime studios have since perfected techniques to draw as little new animation as possible using scrolling or repeating backgrounds still shots of characters sliding across the screen and dialogue which involves only animating mouths while the rest of the screen remains absolutely still a technique not wholly unfamiliar to western animation the overall effect of these techniques such as reduced frame rate several still shots and scrolling backgrounds has led some critics to accuse anime of choppiness or poor quality in general see also limited animation there are often scenes where the frame rate of the animation far exceeds the quality of the rest of the production these are commonly referred to as money shots outside of japan where more effort is put into the animation of one scene to give it emphasis over the rest of the work animator yasuo otsuka was the pioneer of this technique exceptions to these rules are early classic films such as those produced by toei animation up until the mid one nine six zero s and recent big budget films such as those produced by the enormously successful studio ghibli these movies have much higher production values due to their anticipated success at the box office some animators in japan overcome production values by utilizing different techniques than the disney or the old tezuka otsuka methods of animating anime directors such as hiroyuki imaishi cutey honey dead leaves simplify backgrounds so that more attention can be paid to character animation other animators like tatsuyuki tanaka in koji minamoto s eternal family in particular use squash and stretch an animation technique not often used by japanese animators tanaka makes other shortcuts to compensate for this some higher budgeted television and ova original video animation series also forego the shortcuts found in most other anime while different titles and different artists have their own unique artistic styles many stylistic elements have become extremely common some examples have become so common that they are often described as being definitive of anime in general and have been given names of their own the most common is the large eyes style drawn on many anime characters common mainly due to the influence of osamu tezuka who was inspired by the exaggerated features of western cartoon characters such as betty boop and mickey mouse and from disney s bambi tezuka found that large eyes allowed his characters to better express their emotions some western audiences have interpreted such stylized eyes as more caucasian cultural anthropologist matt thorn argues that japanese animators and audiences do not perceive them as inherently more or less foreign when tezuka began drawing ribbon no kishi the first manga specifically targeted at young girls tezuka further exaggerated the size of the characters eyes indeed through ribbon no kishi tezuka set a stylistic template that later sh jo artists tended to follow another variation of this style is chibi or super deformed which usually feature huge eyes an enlarged head and small body other stylistic elements are common as well often in comedic anime characters that are shocked or surprised will perform a face fault in which they display an extremely exaggerated expression angry characters may exhibit a vein or stressmark effect where lines representing bulging veins will appear on their forehead angry women will sometimes summon a mallet from nowhere and strike someone with it leading to the concept of hammerspace male characters will develop a bloody nose around their female love interests typically to indicate arousal this is supposedly due to blood rushing to the face in an exaggerated blush embarrassed characters will invariably produce a massive sweat drop which has become something of a stereotype of anime the degree of stylization varies from title to title some titles make extensive use of common stylization flcl for example is known for its wild exaggerated stylization in contrast titles such as only yesterday a film by isao takahata take a much more realistic approach and feature no stylistic exaggerations another unique aspect of anime not found in other commercial animation markets is the lack of a directoral system in most animation produced around the world animators are all forced to conform to a set style by the director or animation director in japan starting with the animation director yoshinori kanada as a means to save time and money each animator brings his her own style to the work the most extreme examples of this can be found in mindgame or the hakkenden the hakkenden is particularly extreme showing constantly shifting styles of animation based upon the key animator that worked on that particular episode this approach combined with otsuka s money shots make key animators important individuals in the style and production of an anime film many non japanese cartoons are starting to incorporate mainstream anime shortcuts and symbols to appeal to anime s tremendously growing fanbase and cut costs production types of anime most anime can be categorized as one of three types films which are generally released in theaters represent the highest budgets and generally the highest video quality popular anime movies include akira ghost in the shell and spirited away some anime films are only released at film or animation festivals and are shorter and sometimes lower in production values some examples of these are winter days and osamu tezuka s legend of the forest other types of films include compilation movies which are television episodes edited together and presented in theaters for various reasons and are hence a concentrated form of a television serial these may however be longer than the average movie there are also theatrical shorts derived from existing televisions series and billed in japanese theaters together to form feature length showing television series anime is syndicated and broadcast on television on a regular schedule television series are generally low quality compared to ova original video animation and film titles because the production budget is spread out over many episodes rather than a single film or a short series most episodes are about two three minutes in length to fill a typical thirty minute time slot with added commercials one full season is two six episodes and many titles run half seasons or one three episodes most tv series anime episodes will have opening credits closing credits and often an eyecatch a very short scene often humorous or silly that is used to signal the start or end of the commercial break as bumpers in the united states are used in a similar fashion eyecatch scenes are often found in tv series anime and are generally similar throughout the series ova original video animation sometimes oav or original animated video anime is often similar to a television miniseries ovas are typically two to twenty episodes in length one shots are particularly short usually less than film length they are most commonly released directly to video as a general rule ova anime tends to be of high quality approaching that of films titles often have a very regular continuous plot best enjoyed if all episodes are viewed in sequence popular ova titles include flcl bubblegum crisis and tenchi muyo opening credits closing credits and eyecatches may sometimes be found in ova releases but not universally franchising it is very common for one title to spawn several different releases a title that starts as a popular television series might then have a movie produced at a later date a good example is tenchi muyo originally an ova it spawned three movies three television series and several spinoff titles and specials not all successors to an anime are a sequel to the original story prequels and alternate stories are commonly adapted from the original licensing and distribution anime is available outside of japan in localized form licensed anime is modified by western distributors through dubbing into the language of the country the anime may also be edited to alter cultural references that may not be understood by a non japanese person and companies may remove what may be perceived as objectionable content for the fans who may object to the editing and dubbing of anime dvds may be their preference dvd releases often include both the dubbed audio and the original japanese audio with subtitles are typically unedited and lack commercials fansubs although it is a violation of copyright laws in many countries some fans watch fansubs recordings of anime series that have been subtitled by fans watching subtitled japanese versions is usually seen as the intended method of watching anime by enthusiasts the ethical implications of producing distributing or watching fansubs is a topic of much controversy even when fansub groups do not profit from and cease distribution of their work

one none arabic less formally is the largest member of the semitic branch of the afro asiatic language family classification south central semitic and is closely related to hebrew and aramaic it is spoken throughout the arab world and is widely studied and known throughout the islamic world arabic has been a literary language since at least the six th century and is the liturgical language of islam quite a few english words are ultimately derived from arabic often through other european languages especially spanish among them every day vocabulary like sugar sukkar cotton or magazine more recognizable are words like algebra alcohol and zenith see list of english words of arabic origin literary and modern standard arabic the term arabic may refer either to literary arabic or modern standard arabic or to the many localized varieties of arabic commonly called colloquial arabic arabs consider literary arabic as the standard language and tend to view everything else as mere dialects literary arabic literally the most eloquent arabic language refers both to the language of present day media across north africa and the middle east and to the more articulate language of the qur an the expression media here includes most television and radio and all written matter including all books newspapers magazines documents of every kind and reading primers for small children colloquial or dialectal arabic refers to the many national or regional varieties derived from classical arabic spoken daily across north africa and the middle east which constitute the everyday spoken language these sometimes differ enough to be mutually incomprehensible these dialects are not typically written although a certain amount of literature particularly plays and poetry exists in many of them they are often used to varying degrees in informal spoken media such as soap operas and talk shows literary arabic or classical arabic is the official language of all arab countries and is the only form of arabic taught in schools at all stages the sociolinguistic situation of arabic in modern times provides a prime example of the linguistic phenomenon of diglossia the normal use of two separate varieties of the same language usually in different social situations in the case of arabic educated arabs of any nationality can be assumed to speak both their local dialect and their school taught literary arabic to an equal or lesser degree this diglossic situation facilitates code switching in which a speaker switches back and forth unaware between the two varieties of the language sometimes even within the same sentence in instances in which arabs of different nationalities engage in conversation only to find their dialects mutually unintelligible e g a moroccan speaking with a lebanese both should be able to code switch into literary arabic for the sake of communication since the written arabic of today differs from the written arabic of the qur anic era it has become customary in western scholarship and among non arab scholars of arabic to refer to the language of the qur an as classical arabic and the modern language of the media and of formal speech as modern standard arabic arabs on the other hand often use the term to refer to both forms thus placing greater emphasis on the similarities between the two the difference between arabic of the qur anic era and today s classical arabic is only in the degree of eloquence the vocabulary the syntactic and grammatical rules are the same arabic and islam it is sometimes difficult to translate islamic concepts and concepts specific to arab culture without using the original arabic terminology the qur an is expressed in arabic and traditionally muslims deem it impossible to translate in a way that would adequately reflect its exact meaning indeed until recently some schools of thought maintained that it should not be translated at all a list of islamic terms in arabic covers those terms which are too specific to translate in one phrase while arabic is strongly associated with islam and is the language of salah it is also spoken by arab christians oriental jews and smaller sects such as iraqi mandaeans even so a majority of the world s muslims do not actually speak arabic but only know some fixed phrases of the language such as those used in islamic prayer however to counteract this trend non arabic speaking muslims are strongly encouraged to learn the language classification and related languages maltese which is spoken on the mediterranean island of malta is the only surviving european language to derive primarily from arabic though it contains a large number of italian and english borrowings dialects see varieties of arabic for main article colloquial arabic is a collective term for the spoken languages or dialects of people throughout the arab world which as mentioned differ radically from the literary language the main dialectal division is between the maghreb dialects and those of the middle east followed by that between sedentary dialects and the much more conservative bedouin dialects maltese though descended from arabic is considered a separate language speakers of some of these dialects are unable to converse with speakers of another dialect of arabic in particular while middle easterners can generally understand one another they often have trouble understanding maghrebis although the converse is not true due to the popularity of middle eastern especially egyptian films and other media one factor in the differentiation of the dialects is influence from the languages previously spoken in the areas which have typically provided a significant number of new words and have sometimes also influenced pronunciation or word order however a much more significant factor for most dialects is as among romance languages retention or change of meaning of different classical forms thus iraqi aku levantine fiih and north african kayen all mean there is and all come from arabic yakuun fiihi kaa in respectively but now sound very different the major groups are egyptian arabic maghreb arabic algerian arabic moroccan arabic tunisian arabic and western libyan levantine arabic western syrian lebanese palestinian and western jordanian cypriot maronite arabic iraqi arabic khuzestani arabic which has significant persian influence and is not understood by most other arabic speakers gulf arabic eastern syrian kuwaiti saudi arabian persian gulf coast from iraq to oman including much of saudi arabia s eastern province and minorities on the
